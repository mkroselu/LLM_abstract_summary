Tundra vegetation change and impacts on permafrost,"Tundra vegetation productivity and composition are responding rapidly to climatic changes in the Arctic. These changes can, in turn, mitigate or amplify permafrost thaw. In this Review, we synthesize remotely sensed and field-observed vegetation change across the tundra biome, and outline how these shifts could influence permafrost thaw. Permafrost ice content appears to be an important control on local vegetation changes; woody vegetation generally increases in ice-poor uplands, whereas replacement of woody vegetation by (aquatic) graminoids following abrupt permafrost thaw is more frequent in ice-rich Arctic lowlands. These locally observed vegetation changes contribute to regional satellite-observed greening trends, although the interpretation of greening and browning is complicated. Increases in vegetation cover and height generally mitigate permafrost thaw in summer, yet, increase annual soil temperatures through snow-related winter soil warming effects. Strong vegetation–soil feedbacks currently alleviate the consequences of thaw-related disturbances. However, if the increasing scale and frequency of disturbances in a warming Arctic exceeds the capacity for vegetation and permafrost recovery, changes to Arctic ecosystems could be irreversible. To better disentangle vegetation–soil–permafrost interactions, ecological field studies remain crucial, but require better integration with geophysical assessments.

Comparison between random forest and support vector machine algorithms for LULC classification,"Nowadays, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely chosen for classifying satellite images for mapping Earth's surface. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) stand out among these algorithms with their accurate results in the literature. The aim of this study is to analyze the performances of these algorithms on land use and land cover (LULC) classification, especially wetlands which have significant ecological functions. For this purpose, Sentinel-2 satellite image, which is freely provided by European Space Agency (ESA), was used to monitor not only the open surface water body but also around Marmara Lake. The performance evaluation was made with the increasing number of the training dataset. 3 different training datasets having 10, 15, and 20 areas of interest (AOI) per class, respectively were used for the classification of the satellite images acquired in 2015 and 2020. The most accurate results were obtained from the classification with RF algorithm and 20 AOIs. According to obtained results, the change detection analysis of Marmara Lake was investigated for possible reasons. Whereas the water body and wetland have decreased more than 50% between 2015 and 2020, crop sites have increased approximately 50%.  "
"Assessment of land use land cover changes and future predictions using CA-ANN simulation for selangor, Malaysia","Land use land cover (LULC) has altered dramatically because of anthropogenic activities, particularly in places where climate change and population growth are severe. The geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing are widely used techniques for monitoring LULC changes. This study aimed to assess the LULC changes and predict future trends in Selangor, Malaysia. The satellite images from 1991–2021 were classified to develop LULC maps using support vector machine (SVM) classification in ArcGIS. The image classification was based on six different LULC classes, i.e., (i) water, (ii) developed, (iii) barren, (iv) forest, (v) agriculture, and (vi) wetlands. The resulting LULC maps illustrated the area changes from 1991 to 2021 in different classes, where developed, barren, and water lands increased by 15.54%, 1.95%, and 0.53%, respectively. However, agricultural, forest, and wetlands decreased by 3.07%, 14.01%, and 0.94%, respectively. The cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) technique was used to predict the LULC changes from 2031–2051. The percentage of correctness for the simulation was 82.43%, and overall kappa value was 0.72. The prediction maps from 2031–2051 illustrated decreasing trends in (i) agricultural by 3.73%, (ii) forest by 1.09%, (iii) barren by 0.21%, (iv) wetlands by 0.06%, and (v) water by 0.04% and increasing trends in (vi) developed by 5.12%. The outcomes of this study provide crucial knowledge that may help in developing future sustainable planning and management, as well as assist authorities in making informed decisions to improve environmental and ecological conditions."
IoT and artificial intelligence implementations for remote healthcare monitoring systems: A survey,"The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are two of the fastest-growing technologies in the world. With more people moving to cities, the concept of a smart city is not foreign. The idea of a smart city is based on transforming the healthcare sector by increasing its efficiency, lowering costs, and putting the focus back on a better patient care system. Implementing IoT and AI for remote healthcare monitoring (RHM) systems requires a deep understanding of different frameworks in smart cities. These frameworks occur in the form of underlying technologies, devices, systems, models, designs, use cases, and applications. The IoT-based RHM system mainly employs both AI and machine learning (ML) by gathering different records and datasets. On the other hand, ML methods are broadly used to create analytic representations and are incorporated into clinical decision support systems and diverse healthcare service forms. After carefully examining each factor in clinical decision support systems, a unique treatment, lifestyle advice, and care strategy are proposed to patients. The technology used helps to support healthcare applications and analyze activities, body temperature, heart rate, blood glucose, etcetera. Keeping this in mind, this paper provides a survey that focuses on the identification of the most relevant health Internet of things (H-IoT) applications supported by smart city infrastructure. This study also evaluates related technologies and systems for RHM services by understanding the most pertinent monitoring applications based on several models with different corresponding IoT-based sensors. Finally, this research contributes to scientific knowledge by highlighting the main limitations of the topic and recommending possible opportunities in this research area.

Evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models combined time-series satellite data for multiple crop types classification over a …,"Accurate extraction of crop cultivated area and spatial distribution is essential for food security. Crop classification methods based on machine learning and deep learning and remotely sensed time-series data are widely utilized to detect crop planting area. However, few studies assess the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning algorithm integrated time-series satellite data for identifying multiple crop type classification over a large-scale region. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in crop classification and provide a framework for large-scale multiple crop type classification based on time-series of satellite data. The time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and NaE (combined NDVI and EVI) were adopted as input features, and four widely used machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and their integration (Stacking) were compared to examine the performance of multiple crop types (i.e., wheat, corn, wheat-corn, early rice, and early rice-late rice) classification in the North China Plain. The performance of two types of deep learning classifiers: the One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), were also tested. The results showed that the NaE feature performed best among three input features, and the Stacking model produced the highest accuracy (77.12%) compared to other algorithms."
FY-3E: The first operational meteorological satellite mission in an early morning orbit,"Fengyun-3E (FY-3E), the world’s first early-morning-orbit meteorological satellite for civil use, was launched successfully at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on 5 July 2021. The FY-3E satellite will fill the vacancy of the global early-morning-orbit satellite observation, working together with the FY-3C and FY-3D satellites to achieve the data coverage of early morning, morning, and afternoon orbits. The combination of these three satellites will provide global data coverage for numerical weather prediction (NWP) at 6-hour intervals, effectively improving the accuracy and time efficiency of global NWP, which is of great significance to perfect the global earth observing system. In this article, the background and meteorological requirements for the early-morning-orbit satellite are reviewed, and the specifications of the FY-3E satellite, as well as the characteristics of the onboard instrumentation for earth observations, are also introduced. In addition, the ground segment and the retrieved geophysical products are also presented. It is believed that the NWP communities will significantly benefit from an optimal temporal distribution of observations provided by the early morning, mid-morning, and afternoon satellite missions. Further benefits are expected in numerous applications such as the monitoring of severe weather/climate events, the development of improved sampling designs of the diurnal cycle for accurate climate data records, more efficient monitoring of air quality by thermal infrared remote sensing, and the quasi-continuous monitoring of the sun for space weather and climate.

The global 2000-2020 land cover and land use change dataset derived from the Landsat archive: first results,"Recent advances in Landsat archive data processing and characterization enhanced our capacity to map land cover and land use globally with higher precision, temporal frequency, and thematic detail. Here, we present the first results from a project aimed at annual multidecadal land monitoring providing critical information for tracking global progress towards sustainable development. The global 30-m spatial resolution dataset quantifies changes in forest extent and height, cropland, built-up lands, surface water, and perennial snow and ice extent from the year 2000 to 2020. Landsat Analysis Ready Data served as an input for land cover and use mapping. Each thematic product was independently derived using locally and regionally calibrated machine learning tools. Thematic maps validation using a statistical sample of reference data confirmed their high accuracy (user’s and producer’s accuracies above 85% for all land cover and land use themes, except for built-up lands). Our results revealed dramatic changes in global land cover and land use over the past 20 years. The bitemporal dataset is publicly available and serves as a first input for the global land monitoring system.

Permafrost carbon emissions in a changing Arctic,"Arctic permafrost stores nearly 1,700 billion metric tons of frozen and thawing carbon. Anthropogenic warming threatens to release an unknown quantity of this carbon to the atmosphere, influencing the climate in processes collectively known as the permafrost carbon feedback. In this Review, we discuss advances in tracking permafrost carbon dynamics, including mechanisms of abrupt thaw, instrumental observations of carbon release and model predictions of the permafrost carbon feedback. Abrupt thaw and thermokarst could emit a substantial amount of carbon to the atmosphere rapidly (days to years), mobilizing the deep legacy carbon sequestered in Yedoma. Carbon dioxide emissions are proportionally larger than other greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, but expansion of anoxic conditions within thawed permafrost and soils stands to increase the proportion of future methane emissions. Increasingly frequent wildfires in the Arctic will also lead to a notable but unpredictable carbon flux. More detailed monitoring though in situ, airborne and satellite observations will provide a deeper understanding of the Arctic’s future role as a carbon source or sink, and the subsequent impact on the Earth system.

Precision Livestock Farming technologies in pasture-based livestock systems,"Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) encompasses the combined application of single technologies or multiple tools in integrated systems for real-time and individual monitoring of livestock. In grazing systems, some PLF applications could substantially improve farmers’ control of livestock by overcoming issues related to pasture utilisation and management, and animal monitoring and control. A focused literature review was carried out to identify technologies already applied or at an advanced stage of development for livestock management in pastures, specifically cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry. Applications of PLF in pasture-based systems were examined for cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. The earliest technology applied to livestock was the radio frequency identification tag, allowing the identification of individuals, but also for retrieving important information such as maternal pedigree. Walk-over-weigh platforms were used to record individual and flock weights. Coupled with automatic drafting systems, they were tested to divide the animals according to their needs. Few studies have dealt with remote body temperature assessment, although the use of thermography is spreading to monitor both intensively reared and wild animals. Global positioning system and accelerometers are among the most applied technologies, with several solutions available on the market. These tools are used for several purposes, such as animal location, theft prevention, assessment of activity budget, behaviour, and feed intake of grazing animals, as well as for reproduction monitoring (i.e., oestrus, calving, or lambing). Remote sensing by satellite images or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) seems promising for biomass assessment and herd management based on pasture availability, and some attempts to use UAVs to monitor, track, or even muster animals have been reported recently. Virtual fencing is among the upcoming technologies aimed at grazing management. This system allows the management of animals at pasture without physical fences but relies on associative learning between audio cues and an electric shock delivered if the animal does not change direction after the acoustic warning. Regardless of the different technologies applied, some common constraints have been reported on the application of PLF in grazing systems, especially when compared with indoor or confined livestock systems. Battery lifespan, transmission range, service coverage, storage capacity, and economic affordability were the main factors. However, even if the awareness of the existence and the potential of these upcoming tools are still limited, farmers’ and researchers’ demands are increasing, and positive outcomes in terms of rangeland conservation, animal welfare, and labour optimisation are expected from the spread of PLF in grazing systems.

Anchor-free oriented proposal generator for object detection,"Oriented object detection is a practical and challenging task in remote sensing image interpretation. Nowadays, oriented detectors mostly use horizontal boxes as intermedium to derive oriented boxes from them. However, the horizontal boxes are inclined to get small Intersection-over-Unions (IoUs) with ground truths, which may have some undesirable effects, such as introducing redundant noise, mismatching with ground truths, and detracting from the robustness of detectors. In this article, we propose a novel anchor-free oriented proposal generator (AOPG) that abandons horizontal box-related operations from the network architecture. AOPG first produces coarse oriented boxes by a coarse location module (CLM) in an anchor-free manner and then refines them into high-quality oriented proposals. After AOPG, we apply a Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) head to produce the final detection results. Furthermore, the shortage of large-scale datasets is also a hindrance to the development of oriented object detection. To alleviate the data insufficiency, we release a new dataset on the basis of our DIOR dataset and name it DIOR-R. Massive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AOPG. Particularly, without bells and whistles, we achieve the accuracy of 64.41%, 75.24%, and 96.22% mAP on the DIOR-R, DOTA, and HRSC2016 datasets, respectively. Code and models are available at https://github.com/jbwang1997/AOPG ."
A comprehensive survey of the recent studies with UAV for precision agriculture in open fields and greenhouses,"The increasing world population makes it necessary to fight challenges such as climate change and to realize production efficiently and quickly. However, the minimum cost, maximum income, environmental pollution protection and the ability to save water and energy are all factors that should be taken into account in this process. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture to meet all of these criteria serves the purpose of precision agriculture. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can easily obtain real-time data, they have a great potential to address and optimize solutions to the problems faced by agriculture. Despite some limitations, such as the battery, load, weather conditions, etc., UAVs will be used frequently in agriculture in the future because of the valuable data that they obtain and their efficient applications. According to the known literature, UAVs have been carrying out tasks such as spraying, monitoring, yield estimation, weed detection, etc. In recent years, articles related to agricultural UAVs have been presented in journals with high impact factors. Most precision agriculture applications with UAVs occur in outdoor environments where GPS access is available, which provides more reliable control of the UAV in both manual and autonomous flights. On the other hand, there are almost no UAV-based applications in greenhouses where all-season crop production is available. This paper emphasizes this deficiency and provides a comprehensive review of the use of UAVs for agricultural tasks and highlights the importance of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a UAV solution in the greenhouse."
Morphological transformation and spatial-logical aggregation for tree species classification using hyperspectral imagery,"Hyperspectral image (HSI) consists of abundant spectral and spatial characteristics, which contribute to a more accurate identification of materials and land covers. However, most existing methods of hyperspectral image analysis primarily focus on spectral knowledge or coarse-grained spatial information while neglecting the fine-grained morphological structures. In the classification task of complex objects, spatial morphological differences can help to search for the boundary of fine-grained classes, e.g., forestry tree species. Focusing on subtle traits extraction, a spatial-logical aggregation network (SLA-NET) is proposed with morphological transformation for tree species classification. The morphological operators are effectively embedded with the trainable structuring elements, which contributes to distinctive morphological representations. We evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method on two tree species datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SLA-NET significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art classifiers."
Recent advances in agronomic and physio-molecular approaches for improving nitrogen use efficiency in crop plants,"The efficiency with which plants use nutrients to create biomass and/or grain is determined by the interaction of environmental and plant intrinsic factors. The major macronutrients, especially nitrogen (N), limit plant growth and development (1.5–2% of dry biomass) and have a direct impact on global food supply, fertilizer demand, and concern with environmental health. In the present time, the global consumption of N fertilizer is nearly 120 MT (million tons), and the N efficiency ranges from 25 to 50% of applied N. The dynamic range of ideal internal N concentrations is extremely large, necessitating stringent management to ensure that its requirements are met across various categories of developmental and environmental situations. Furthermore, approximately 60 percent of arable land is mineral deficient and/or mineral toxic around the world. The use of chemical fertilizers adds to the cost of production for the farmers and also increases environmental pollution. Therefore, the present study focused on the advancement in fertilizer approaches, comprising the use of biochar, zeolite, and customized nano and bio-fertilizers which had shown to be effective in improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) with lower soil degradation. Consequently, adopting precision farming, crop modeling, and the use of remote sensing technologies such as chlorophyll meters, leaf color charts, etc. assist in reducing the application of N fertilizer. This study also discussed the role of crucial plant attributes such as root structure architecture in improving the uptake and transport of N efficiency. The crosstalk of N with other soil nutrients plays a crucial role in nutrient homeostasis, which is also discussed thoroughly in this analysis. At the end, this review highlights the more efficient and accurate molecular strategies and techniques such as N transporters, transgenes, and omics, which are opening up intriguing possibilities for the detailed investigation of the molecular components that contribute to nitrogen utilization efficiency, thus expanding our knowledge of plant nutrition for future global food security.

A prolonged artificial nighttime-light dataset of China (1984-2020),"Nighttime light remote sensing has been an increasingly important proxy for human activities. Despite an urgent need for long-term products and pilot explorations in synthesizing them, the publicly available long-term products are limited. A Night-Time Light convolutional LSTM network is proposed and applied the network to produce a 1-km annual Prolonged Artificial Nighttime-light DAtaset of China (PANDA-China) from 1984 to 2020. Assessments between modeled and original images show that on average the RMSE reaches 0.73, the coefficient of determination (R2) reaches 0.95, and the linear slope is 0.99 at the pixel level, indicating a high confidence in the quality of generated data products. Quantitative and visual comparisons witness PANDA-China’s superiority against other NTL datasets in its significantly longer NTL dynamics, higher temporal consistency, and better correlations with socioeconomics (built-up areas, gross domestic product, population) characterizing the most relevant indicator in different development phases. The PANDA-China product provides an unprecedented opportunity to trace nighttime light dynamics in the past four decades."
Global trends of forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019,"Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.

Spectral–spatial feature tokenization transformer for hyperspectral image classification,"In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, each pixel sample is assigned to a land-cover category. In the recent past, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based HSI classification methods have greatly improved performance due to their superior ability to represent features. However, these methods have limited ability to obtain deep semantic features, and as the layer’s number increases, computational costs rise significantly. The transformer framework can represent high-level semantic features well. In this article, a spectral–spatial feature tokenization transformer (SSFTT) method is proposed to capture spectral–spatial features and high-level semantic features. First, a spectral–spatial feature extraction module is built to extract low-level features. This module is composed of a 3-D convolution layer and a 2-D convolution layer, which are used to extract the shallow spectral and spatial features. Second, a Gaussian weighted feature tokenizer is introduced for features transformation. Third, the transformed features are input into the transformer encoder module for feature representation and learning. Finally, a linear layer is used to identify the first learnable token to obtain the sample label. Using three standard datasets, experimental analysis confirms that the computation time is less than other deep learning methods and the performance of the classification outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/zgr6010/HSI_SSFTT for the sake of reproducibility."
Cloud-Enabled Neural Networks for Intelligent Vehicle Emissions Tracking and Analysis,"A system for smart vehicle emissions monitoring and analysis using cloud computing and neural networks is presented in this paper. As global environmental concerns develop, monitoring and reducing vehicle emissions is crucial. Scalability and real-time data processing are issues for traditional approaches. Thus, cloud-enabled neural network architecture for scalable and efficient vehicle emissions monitoring using distributed computing is developed. A neural network model trained on various vehicle emission datasets, allowing for precise pattern analysis and prediction of emissions. The scalability of the system is guaranteed by using cloud resources, which can accommodate the rising amount of data created by an increasing number of vehicles. By incorporating cloud-based data processing seamlessly, real-time monitoring is accomplished, enabling immediate analysis and prompt emission alerts. The suggested emissions tracking platform is robust and scalable to intelligent transportation systems by revealing vehicle emissions’ environmental effect. Future smart city and sustainable urban transportation developments are built on cloud computing and neural networks. The proposed system shows how cloud-enabled neural networks may solve complicated vehicle emissions problems."

PDBSNet: Pixel-shuffle downsampling blind-spot reconstruction network for hyperspectral anomaly detection,"Recent years have witnessed significant advances of deep learning technology in hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD). Among these methods, existing unsupervised learning techniques that exploit image reconstruction errors to detect anomalous targets not only generate backgrounds but also reconstruct anomalies to a certain extent, thus failing to recognize anomalies from the original hyperspectral image (HSI). In order to train an efficient background reconstruction network, this article proposes a new pixel-shuffle downsampling blind-spot reconstruction network (called PDBSNet) that operates in a self-supervised fashion. On the one hand, PDBSNet adopts a blind-spot architecture with the receptive field, whose center pixel is set as a blind spot (meaning that the network is unable to see the center pixel), and reconstructs the spectral information of the center pixel using its neighbors. Given that the spectral signatures of anomalous targets are significantly different from those of neighboring pixels, our network tends to generate high reconstruction errors for anomalous pixels and low reconstruction errors for background pixels, and the above characterization of blind-spot architecture is well-suited for the HAD task. On the other hand, we introduce the pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) technique, which extends the application range of the blind-spot framework due to the fact that it breaks the spatial correlation between pixels in anomalous targets and improves the discrimination between the anomalous pixels and shuffled neighboring backgrounds. Taken together, our PDBSNet integrates the blind-spot architecture and the PD strategy, effectively enhancing the feature representation of the background and weakening the feature expression of anomalies. It is expected to increase the reconstruction error of anomalous objects, while the differences between the original HSI and the reconstructed one are taken as anomaly scores.

Deep learning techniques to classify agricultural crops through UAV imagery: A review,"During the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technologies are widely used to improve agriculture productivity while reducing drudgery, inspection time, and crop management cost. Moreover, they are able to cover large areas in a matter of a few minutes. Due to the impressive technological advancement, UAV-based remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to collect valuable data that could be used to achieve many precision agriculture applications, including crop/plant classification.

Enhanced intelligent smart home control and security system based on deep learning model,"Security of lives and properties is highly important for enhanced quality living. Smart home automation and its application have received much progress towards convenience, comfort, safety, and home security. With the advances in technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the home environment has witnessed an improved remote control of appliances, monitoring, and home security over the internet. Several home automation systems have been developed to monitor movements in the home and report to the user. Existing home automation systems detect motion and have surveillance for home security. However, the logical aspect of averting unnecessary or fake notifications is still a major area of challenge. Intelligent response and monitoring make smart home automation efficient. This work presents an intelligent home automation system for controlling home appliances, monitoring environmental factors, and detecting movement in the home and its surroundings. A deep learning model is proposed for motion recognition and classification based on the detected movement patterns. Using a deep learning model, an algorithm is developed to enhance the smart home automation system for intruder detection and forestall the occurrence of false alarms. A human detected by the surveillance camera is classified as an intruder or home occupant based on his walking pattern. The proposed method’s prototype was implemented using an ESP32 camera for surveillance, a PIR motion sensor, an ESP8266 development board, a 5 V four-channel relay module, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The environmental conditions measured were evaluated using a mathematical model for the response time to effectively show the accuracy of the DHT sensor for weather monitoring and future prediction. An experimental analysis of human motion patterns was performed using the CNN model to evaluate the classification for the detection of humans. The CNN classification model gave an accuracy of 99.8%.

"Monitoring urban expansion and loss of agriculture on the north coast of west java province, Indonesia, using Google Earth engine and intensity analysis","Uncontrolled urban expansion resulting from urbanization has a disastrous impact on agricultural land. This situation is being experienced by the densely populated and fertile island Java in Indonesia. Remote sensing technologies have developed rapidly in recent years, including the creation of Google Earth Engine (GEE). Intensity analysis (IA) is increasingly being used to systematically and substantially analyze land-use/land-cover (LULC) change. As yet, however, no study of land conversion from agriculture to urban areas in Indonesia has adopted GEE and IA approaches simultaneously. Therefore, this study aims to monitor urban penetration to agricultural land in the north coastal region of West Java Province by applying both methods to two time intervals: 2003–2013 and 2013–2020. Landsat data and a robust random forest (RF) classifier available in GEE were chosen for producing LULC maps. Monitoring LULC change using GEE and IA has demonstrated reliable findings. The overall accuracy of Landsat image classification results for 2003, 2013, and 2020 were 88%, 87%, and 88%, respectively. IA outputs at interval levels for all categories showed that the annual change-of-area rate was higher during 2013–2020 than during 2003–2013. At the category level, IA results showed that the area of agricultural land experienced net losses in both periods, with net loss in 2013–2020 being 2.3 times greater than that in 2003–2013 (∼1,850 ha per year). In contrast, the built-up area made net gains in both periods, reaching almost twice as much in the second period as in the first (∼2,030 ha per year). The transition-level IA performed proved that agricultural land had been the primary target for the expansion of built-up areas. The most extensive spatial distribution of land conversion from agriculture to built-up area was concentrated in the regencies of Bekasi, Karawang, and Cirebon. These findings are intended to provide stakeholders with enrichment in terms of available literature and with valuable inputs useful for identifying better urban and regional planning policies in Indonesia and similar regions.

However, monitoring of hydroponics farming is a challenging task due to the simultaneous supervising of numerous parameters, nutrition suggestion, and plant diagnosis system. But the recent technological developments are quite useful to solve these problems by adopting the artificial intelligence-based controlling algorithms in agriculture sector. Therefore, this article focuses on implementation of mobile application integrated artificial intelligence based smart hydroponics expert system, hereafter referred as AI-SHES with Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The proposed AI-SHES with IoT consists of three phases, where the first phase implements hardware environment equipped with real-time sensors such as NPK soil, sunlight, turbidity, pH, temperature, water level, and camera module which are controlled by Raspberry Pi processor. The second phase implements deep learning convolutional neural network (DLCNN) model for best nutrient level prediction and plant disease detection and classification. In third phase, farmers can monitor the sensor data and plant leaf disease status using an Android-based mobile application, which is connected over IoT environment. In this manner, the farmer can continuously track the status of his field using the mobile app. In addition, the proposed AI-SHES also develops the automated mode, which makes the complete environment in automatic control manner and takes the necessary actions in hydroponics field to increase the productivity. The obtained simulation results on disease detection and classification using proposed AI-SHES with IoT disclose superior performance in terms of accuracy, F-measure with 99.29%, and 99.23%, respectively."
Delivering blockchain's potential for environmental sustainability,"• Blockchain could help address environmental governance challenges by offering a secure and
verifiable record of who exchanges what with whom and who has what at a given time.
• Blockchain can be used to reinforce entitlements to use a natural resource, substantiate claims of
reduced environmental impact and incentivise environmentally sustainable actions.
• There are key challenges to be addressed if blockchain is to work in the environmental sector,
which include a lack of access to digital infrastructure among poorer and often rural communities,
who are the stewards of many natural resources and environmental services.
• To realise more of the potential benefits of blockchain for environmental sustainability:
• governments in poorer countries will need to invest in innovation and digital infrastructure to
ensure their citizens can engage with and shape the opportunities that blockchain can create
• governments in wealthier countries will need to support these efforts, and encourage
innovation in less energy intensive blockchain technology
• firms will need to support innovators in low- and middle-income countries, and target and
tailor blockchain solutions to environmental sustainability problems that the technology can
really address."
A review of the application of machine learning in water quality evaluation,"With the rapid increase in the volume of data on the aquatic environment, machine learning has become an important tool for data analysis, classification, and prediction. Unlike traditional models used in water-related research, data-driven models based on machine learning can efficiently solve more complex nonlinear problems. In water environment research, models and conclusions derived from machine learning have been applied to the construction, monitoring, simulation, evaluation, and optimization of various water treatment and management systems. Additionally, machine learning can provide solutions for water pollution control, water quality improvement, and watershed ecosystem security management. In this review, we describe the cases in which machine learning algorithms have been applied to evaluate the water quality in different water environments, such as surface water, groundwater, drinking water, sewage, and seawater. Furthermore, we propose possible future applications of machine learning approaches to water environments.

Environmental outcomes of the US renewable fuel standard,"The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) specifies the use of biofuels in the United States and thereby guides nearly half of all global biofuel production, yet outcomes of this keystone climate and environmental regulation remain unclear. Here we combine econometric analyses, land use observations, and biophysical models to estimate the realized effects of the RFS in aggregate and down to the scale of individual agricultural fields across the United States. We find that the RFS increased corn prices by 30% and the prices of other crops by 20%, which, in turn, expanded US corn cultivation by 2.8 Mha (8.7%) and total cropland by 2.1 Mha (2.4%) in the years following policy enactment (2008 to 2016). These changes increased annual nationwide fertilizer use by 3 to 8%, increased water quality degradants by 3 to 5%, and caused enough domestic land use change emissions such that the carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher. These tradeoffs must be weighed alongside the benefits of biofuels as decision-makers consider the future of renewable energy policies and the potential for fuels like corn ethanol to meet climate mitigation goals."
Ultra-sensitive polarization-resolved black phosphorus homojunction photodetector defined by ferroelectric domains,"With the further miniaturization and integration of multi-dimensional optical information detection devices, polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on anisotropic low-dimension materials have attractive potential applications. However, the performance of these devices is restricted by intrinsic property of materials leading to a small polarization ratio of the detectors. Here, we construct a black phosphorus (BP) homojunction photodetector defined by ferroelectric domains with ultra-sensitive polarization photoresponse. With the modulation of ferroelectric field, the BP exhibits anisotropic dispersion changes, leading an increased photothermalelectric (PTE) current in the armchair (AC) direction. Moreover, the PN junction can promote the PTE current and accelerate carrier separation. As a result, the BP photodetector demonstrates an ultrahigh polarization ratio (PR) of 288 at 1450 nm incident light, a large photoresponsivity of 1.06 A/W, and a high detectivity of 1.27 × 1011 cmHz1/2W−1 at room temperature. This work reveals the great potential of BP in future polarized light detection.

Sustainable strategies in onshore gas exploration: Incorporating carbon capture for environmental compliance,"The exploration and extraction of onshore gas resources play a pivotal role in meeting global energy demands. However, traditional practices in onshore gas exploration often come at a significant environmental cost, particularly in terms of carbon emissions. In response to growing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, there is an urgent need for sustainable strategies that incorporate carbon capture technologies into onshore gas exploration processes. This paper aims to explore various sustainable strategies that can be implemented in onshore gas exploration, focusing on the integration of carbon capture to ensure environmental compliance. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper identifies key challenges and opportunities in implementing carbon capture technologies in onshore gas exploration. Furthermore, it examines the economic, technical, and regulatory aspects of incorporating carbon capture into onshore gas exploration operations. The paper also discusses potential synergies between carbon capture and other sustainable practices, such as methane reduction and ecosystem restoration. Ultimately, this paper provides insights into how onshore gas exploration can transition towards a more sustainable and environmentally responsible industry, while still meeting energy demands."
Climate change risks to global forest health: emergence of unexpected events of elevated tree mortality worldwide,"Recent observations of elevated tree mortality following climate extremes, like heat and drought, raise concerns about climate change risks to global forest health. We currently lack both sufficient data and understanding to identify whether these observations represent a global trend toward increasing tree mortality. Here, we document events of sudden and unexpected elevated tree mortality following heat and drought events in ecosystems that previously were considered tolerant or not at risk of exposure. These events underscore the fact that climate change may affect forests with unexpected force in the future. We use the events as examples to highlight current difficulties and challenges for realistically predicting such tree mortality events and the uncertainties about future forest condition. Advances in remote sensing technology and greater availably of high-resolution data, from both field assessments and satellites, are needed to improve both understanding and prediction of forest responses to future climate change.

Citizen science in environmental and ecological sciences,"Citizen science is an increasingly acknowledged approach applied in many scientific domains, and particularly within the environmental and ecological sciences, in which non-professional participants contribute to data collection to advance scientific research. We present contributory citizen science as a valuable method to scientists and practitioners within the environmental and ecological sciences, focusing on the full life cycle of citizen science practice, from design to implementation, evaluation and data management. We highlight key issues in citizen science and how to address them, such as participant engagement and retention, data quality assurance and bias correction, as well as ethical considerations regarding data sharing. We also provide a range of examples to illustrate the diversity of applications, from biodiversity research and land cover assessment to forest health monitoring and marine pollution. The aspects of reproducibility and data sharing are considered, placing citizen science within an encompassing open science perspective. Finally, we discuss its limitations and challenges and present an outlook for the application of citizen science in multiple science domains.

Perspectives in machine learning for wildlife conservation,"Inexpensive and accessible sensors are accelerating data acquisition in animal ecology. These technologies hold great potential for large-scale ecological understanding, but are limited by current processing approaches which inefficiently distill data into relevant information. We argue that animal ecologists can capitalize on large datasets generated by modern sensors by combining machine learning approaches with domain knowledge. Incorporating machine learning into ecological workflows could improve inputs for ecological models and lead to integrated hybrid modeling tools. This approach will require close interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the quality of novel approaches and train a new generation of data scientists in ecology and conservation.
