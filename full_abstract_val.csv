Improved estimation of the global top-of-atmosphere albedo from AVHRR data,"The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo, a key component of the earth's energy balance, can be monitored regularly by satellite observations. Compared to the previous study Song et al. (2018), this paper estimates TOA albedo by directly linking Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) narrowband reflectance with TOA broadband albedo determined by NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instead of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The TOA albedo product developed in this study has an increased spatial resolution, from 1° to 0.05°, and its starting year has been extended from 2000 to 1981, compared to the CERES TOA albedo product. Models of lands and oceans are established separately under different atmospheric and surface conditions using gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) method instead of the linear regression models in the previous study. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the cloudy-sky, clear-sky and snow-cover models over land are 11.2%, 9.2% and 2.3%, respectively; over oceans they are 14.6%, 10.6% and 5.6%, respectively. Compared to Song et al. (2018), the improvements of the three models over land are 28.8%, 29.2% and 68.6%, respectively. Compared to the CERES product, the new product is much more accurate than that from our previous study. The global monthly mean differences of the TOA albedo obtained with the GBRT product and CERES from 2001 to 2014 are mostly less than 5%."
Machine learning and remote sensing integration for leveraging urban sustainability: A review and framework,"Climate change and rapid urbanisation exacerbated multiple urban issues threatening urban sustainability. Numerous studies integrated machine learning and remote sensing to monitor urban issues and develop mitigation strategies for sustainability. However, few studies comparatively analysed joint applications of machine learning and remote sensing for urban issues and sustainability. This paper presents a systematic review and formulates a framework integrating machine learning and remote sensing in urban studies. The literature analysis reveals: Most studies occurred in Asia, Europe, and North America, driven by technical and ethical factors, highlighting responsible approaches for data-scarce regions; Reviewed studies prioritised physical spatial aspects over socioeconomic factors, requiring multi-source data for comprehensive analysis; Conventional satellite, aerial images, and Lidar data are prevalent due to affordability, quality, and accessibility; Although supervised machine learning dominates, unsupervised methods and algorithm selection paradigms require exploration; Integration offers accurate results and thorough analysis in image processing and analytics, while image acquisition and decision-making necessitate human supervision. This paper provides a comprehensive review and an integrative framework for machine learning and remote sensing, enriching insights into their potential for urban studies and spatial analytics. The study informs urban planning and policymaking by promoting efficient management via enhanced machine learning and remote sensing integration, and bolstering data-driven decision-making."

A review of multi-class change detection for satellite remote sensing imagery,"Change Detection (CD) provides a research basis for environmental monitoring, urban expansion and reconstruction as well as disaster assessment, by identifying the changes of ground objects in different time periods. Traditional CD focused on the Binary Change Detection (BCD), focusing solely on the change and no-change regions. Due to the dynamic progress of earth observation satellite techniques, the spatial resolution of remote sensing images continues to increase, Multi-class Change Detection (MCD) which can reflect more detailed land change has become a hot research direction in the field of CD. Although many scholars have reviewed change detection at present, most of the work still focuses on BCD. This paper focuses on the recent progress in MCD, which includes five major aspects: challenges, datasets, methods, applications and future research direction. Specifically, the background of MCD is first introduced. Then, the major difficulties and challenges in MCD are discussed and delineated. The benchmark datasets for MCD are described, and the available open datasets are listed. Moreover, MCD is further divided into three categories and the specific techniques are described, respectively. Subsequently, the common applications of MCD are described. Finally, the relevant literature in the main journals of remote sensing in the past five years are analyzed and the development and future research direction of MCD are discussed. This review will help researchers understand this field and provide a reference for the subsequent development of MCD. Our collections of MCD benchmark datasets are available at:"
Environmental hazard assessment and monitoring for air pollution using machine learning and remote sensing,"The prediction and study of air pollution is a complex process due to the presence of controlling factors, different land use, and different sources for the elaboration of pollution. In this study, we applied the machine learning technique (Random Forest) with time series of particulate matter pollution records to predict and develop a particulate matter pollution susceptibility map. The applied method is to strict measures and to better manage particulate matter pollution in Ras Garib city, Egypt as a case study. Air pollution data for the period between 2018 and 2021 is collected using five air quality stations. Some of these stations are located near highly urbanized locations and could be dense with the current rates of development in the future. The random forest was applied to verify and visualize the relationships between the particulate matter and different independent variables. Spectral bands of Landsat OLI 8 imaginary and land cover/land use indices were used to prepare independent variables. Analysis of the results reveals that the proper air quality distribution monitoring stations would provide a deep insight into the pollution distribution over the study site. Distance from the roads and the land surface temperature has a significant effect on the distribution of air quality distribution. The obtained probability and classification maps were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The outcome prediction maps are reasonable and will be helpful for future air quality monitoring and improvements. Furthermore, the applied method of pollutant concentration prediction is able to improve decision-making and provide appropriate solutions."
Progress and challenges in intelligent remote sensing satellite systems,"Due to advances in remote sensing satellite imaging and image processing technologies and their wide applications, intelligent remote sensing satellites are facing an opportunity for rapid development. The key technologies, standards, and laws of intelligent remote sensing satellites are also experiencing a series of new challenges. Novel concepts and key technologies in the intelligent hyperspectral remote sensing satellite system have been proposed since 2011. The aim of these intelligent remote sensing satellites is to provide real-time, accurate, and personalized remote sensing information services. This article reviews the current developments in new-generation intelligent remote sensing satellite systems, with a focus on intelligent remote sensing satellite platforms, imaging payloads, onboard processing systems, and other key technological chains. The technological breakthroughs and current defects of intelligence-oriented designs are also analyzed. Intelligent remote sensing satellites collect personalized remote sensing data and information, with real-time data features and information interaction between remote sensing satellites or between satellites and the ground. Such developments will expand the use of remote sensing applications beyond government departments and industrial users to a massive number of individual users. However, this extension faces challenges regarding privacy protection, societal values, and laws regarding the sharing and distribution of data and information."
Remote sensing of indoor thermal environment from outside the building through window opening gap by using infrared camera,"Investigation of housing indoor temperature is important for understanding the comfort, health and living conditions of the local residents. The traditional method to measure indoor temperature is to place sensors at the target places, which is not only expensive but also inconvenient for indoor temperature investigation, especially for the investigation at community and city scale. In this study, a novel method was proposed to obtain the indoor temperatures remotely from outside the building through window opening area using and infrared camera. Compared with the traditional contact measurement method, the proposed remote sensing method could detect the indoor temperature without entering the room. Moreover, the infrared image could reflect the spatial distribution information of indoor temperature. To verify the feasibility and accuracy of this method, an experiment was conducted in a test room under heating, transitional, and cooling conditions with various window opening grades. It was found that the infrared images at the window opening area could reflect the spatial distribution of indoor temperature with an accuracy within 0.5 °C under stable heating and transitional conditions. In the fan coil cooling condition, however, although the infrared image can reflect the cold air flow pattern, the deviations between the infrared temperature and the measured room temperature exceeded 1.0 °C. The effect of window opening grade on the recognition accuracy kept within 0.5 °C."
"Remote sensing for monitoring tropical dryland forests: A review of current research, knowledge gaps and future directions for Southern Africa","Climate change, manifest via rising temperatures, extreme drought, and associated anthropogenic activities, has a negative impact on the health and development of tropical dryland forests. Southern Africa encompasses significant areas of dryland forests that are important to local communities but are facing rapid deforestation and are highly vulnerable to biome degradation from land uses and extreme climate events. Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies helps to assess and monitor forest ecosystems and provide spatially explicit, operational, and long-term data to assist the sustainable use of tropical environment landscapes. The period from 2010 onwards has seen the rapid development of remote sensing research on tropical forests, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This review aims to analyse and synthesise the evidence published in peer review studies with a focus on optical and radar remote sensing of dryland forests in Southern Africa from 1997–2020. For this study, 137 citation indexed research publications have been analysed with respect to publication timing, study location, spatial and temporal scale of applied remote sensing data, satellite sensors or platforms employed, research topics considered, and overall outcomes of the studies. This enabled us to provide a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, major research topics studies, EO product gaps/challenges, and to propose ways in which challenges may be overcome. It is hoped that this review will motivate discussion and encourage uptake of new remote sensing tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), data (e.g., the Sentinel satellites), improved vegetation parameters (e.g., red-edge related indices, vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and methodologies (e.g., data fusion or deep learning, etc.), where these have potential applications in monitoring dryland forests."
Mapping bottom type and water depth in shallow coastal waters with satellite remote sensing,"Species composition of benthic macroalgal cover and the changes therein are indicators of the trophic state of aquatic ecosystems. On the other hand, mapping and knowledge of water depth in shallow water areas, not accessible by hydrographical ships, is important for several reasons. This study assessed the suitability of high spatial resolution multispectral and medium spatial resolution hyperspectral data for mapping water depth and benthic macroalgal cover in shallow coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. Results of this study indicate that use of multispectral satellite data with high spatial resolution is preferable to using hyperspectral medium resolution data in mapping benthic macroalgal cover in areas where the spatial heterogeneity is very high. In case of a single image and availability of in situ data, multispectral high spatial resolution (2.4 m) satellite QuickBird can provide more detailed information about benthic cover than was assumed based on the shape of reflectance spectra of different bottom types and spectral resolution of the sensor. Depth maps of shallow (less than 3 metres) waters proved to be reliable except in turbid water areas with no bottom visibility."
"Impact of urbanization on land surface temperature and surface urban heat Island using optical remote sensing data: A case study of Jeju Island, Republic of Korea","Urbanization changes the existing form of land use and cover (LULC) which can influence the land surface temperature (LST). Therefore, it is important to present the causes of urban heat island (UHI) which is usually linked with anthropogenic activities. There are very few studies on thermal behavior of Korean cities in literature. Hence, in this study we have estimated the LULC of Jeju island and analyzed LST using Landsat (TM/ETM+/OLI) images for the last two decades. The supervised image classification method employed with maximum likelihood classifier algorithm was used to classify the images and thermal band was used to calculate the LST. We have used simplified urban extent (SUE) algorithm to calculate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and eventually we have correlated the SUHI with mean wind speed of Jeju Island. The results of LULC revealed that urban area increased from 8.69% in 2002 to 20.81% in 2021 and in this period barren land decreased by 34.88% due to urban expansion. Interestingly forest region has been slightly increased which is influenced by decreasing barren land. The accuracy was assessed using confusion matrix for the classified images and results revealed an overall accuracy of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.92 with kappa coefficient of 79.02%, 76.45% and 88.05% for the years of 2002, 2011, and 2021 respectively. The LST of all LULC classes were calculated which revealed the highest temperature for urban class which is followed by barren land. However, the forest cover and water body have the lowest temperature in the island. The intensity of surface urban heat island (SUHI) was increased from 2.47 °C (2002) to 3.10 °C (2021). We have correlated the wind speed and SUHI which revealed that SUHI and wind speed has inverse relationship. The outcome of this research can be utilized by the policymakers, urban planners, architects, and climatologist to develop policy related to climate-resilient cities.

Spatially explicit carbon emissions by remote sensing and social sensing,"Scientific simulation of carbon emissions is an important prerequisite for achieving low-carbon green development and carbon peak and carbon neutralization. This study proposed a carbon emissions spatialization method based on nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing and municipal electricity social sensing. First, the economics-energy comprehensive index (EECI) was proposed by integrating the NTL and municipal electricity consumption (EC) data. Second, the carbon emissions were spatialized at a fine scale based on NTL, EC, and EECI, respectively. Finally, the geographical detector model was applied to quantify the influencing factors on carbon emissions from the perspectives of individuals and interactions. Results show that combining remote sensing and social sensing data helps depict carbon emissions accurately. The factor analysis found that GDP and population were the basis of carbon emissions, while the secondary industry and urbanization rate were the direct factors. This study is expected to provide constructive suggestions and methods for emission reduction, carbon peak, and carbon neutrality in high-density cities in China."
Land use land cover classification of remote sensing images based on the deep learning approaches: a statistical analysis and review,"Over the last few years, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained popularity and have become the new standard for data processing in remote sensing analysis. Deep learning architectures have drawn significant attention due to their improved performance in a variety of segmentation, classification, and other machine vision applications. In remote sensing, land use and land cover (LULC) are critical components of a wide variety of environmental applications. Changes in land use on a spatial and temporal scale occur due to accuracy, the capacity to develop, flexibility, uncertainty, structure, and the capability to integrate available models. Therefore, LULC modeling’s high performance demands the employment of a wide variety of model types in remote sensing, which include dynamic, statistical, and DL models. In this study, we first analysed several key findings and research gaps in traditional technology while discussing various software applications used for LULC analysis. Second, the fundamental DL and ML concepts applicable to LULC are introduced with their merits and demerits. We employ a comprehensive review of distinct DL architectures and a custom framework to handle the challenging task of detecting changes in LULC. Subsequently, a detailed statistical analysis is conducted on the”Scopus database” to ascertain current trends in LULC utilising DL methods. This overview encompasses practically all applications and technologies in the field of LULC, from preprocessing to mapping. Finally, we conclude with a proposal for researchers to perform future potential using state-of-the-art methodologies.

Change detection in remote sensing image data comparing algebraic and machine learning methods,"Remote sensing technology has penetrated all the natural resource segments as it provides precise information in an image mode. Remote sensing satellites are currently the fastest-growing source of geographic area information. With the continuous change in the earth’s surface and the wide application of remote sensing, change detection is very useful for monitoring environmental and human needs. So, it is necessary to develop automatic change detection techniques to improve the quality and reduce the time required by manual image analysis. This work focuses on the improvement of the classification accuracy of the machine learning techniques by reviewing the training samples and comparing the post-classification comparison with the image differencing in the algebraic technique. Landsat data are medium spatial resolution data; that is why pixel-wise computation has been applied. Two change detection techniques have been studied by applying a decision tree algorithm using a separability matrix and image differencing. The first change detection, e.g., the separability matrix, is a post-classification comparison in which individual images are classified by a decision tree algorithm. The second change detection is, e.g., the image differencing change detection technique in which changed and unchanged pixels are determined by applying the corner method to calculate the threshold on the changing image. The performance of the machine learning algorithm has been validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the change detection using the post-classification method produced better results when compared to the image differencing of the algebraic change detection technique."
Detection and assessment of the spatio-temporal land use/cover change in the Thai Binh province of Vietnam's Red River delta using remote sensing and GIS,"The land is one of the prime natural resources of a country, and its transformation is a natural process that cannot be stopped but can be regulated. The issues of land use change and land cover change (LULC) have been a concern in various fields of research on management, monitoring, land planning, landslides, erosion, and global climate change for sustainable development purposes. This study aims to monitor the spatial–temporal land use pattern changes in the lowland Thai Binh province of Vietnam’s Red River Delta and its driving force factors by applying remote sensing (RS) images and GIS techniques during 2000–2020. The supervised classification technique was implemented to classify these images into six significant classes (waterbodies, forests, agriculture, aquaculture, settlements, and bare soil/rock). The Kappa coefficient to evaluate the classification accuracy obtained values greater than 0.8 for all three studied years (2000, 2010, and 2020). The results show that the agriculture class area decreased sharply from 1255.01 km2 in 2000 to 740.49 km2 in 2020. On the other hand, the settlement area increased sharply and continuously during the studied 20-year period from 207.00 km2 in 2000 to 727.07 km2 in 2020. Meanwhile, the waterbodies, forests, aquaculture, and bare soil/rock classes have minor changes. The findings demonstrate that the land use changes in the study area during the past 20 years are due to socioeconomic development, especially urbanization, which provides essential insights for land use management in future planning."
Multi-source remote sensing data shows a significant increase in vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau since 2000,"In recent years, there has been growing concern that vegetation changes on the Tibetan Plateau are associated with climate change (temperature and precipitation) and human activities. This study used six types of remote sensing vegetation data, including GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI, MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), SPOT Vegetation (Spot-VGT) NDVI, LAI (Leaf Area Index) and NPP (Net Primary Productivity), and applied the maximum synthesis method, trend analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate statistical analysis to investigate vegetation change processes since the 1980s. The study showed that the amount of vegetation on the TP had increased significantly since 2000 (p < .01), especially in the northeastern part of the TP. There was no significant change prior to 2000. The different vegetation data sources varied greatly. Four remote sensing indices, MODIS EVI, Spot-VGT NDVI, LAI, and NPP, showed a significant increase in vegetation from 2000, accounting for 16.18%, 44.55%, 30.44% and 8.94% of the total area, respectively (p < .05). Multiple data sources provided a more comprehensive understanding, whereas a single data source had substantial uncertainty. Human activities, such as the implementation of large-scale ecological projects, played a dominant role in increasing vegetation, while climate change played a subsidiary role. The MODIS EVI, Spot-VGT NDVI, LAI, and NPP data showed that the area of increased vegetation caused by human activities accounted for 53.51%, 45.68%, 37.52%, and 31.79% of the total area of the TP, respectively. The relative increase from climate change was 10.28%, 17.49%, 13.15%, and 8.82%, respectively. The current study applied multi-source remotely sensed vegetation data, which effectively reduced the uncertainty caused by individual data sources and provided more rigorous and scientific research conclusions."
"Flash flood-induced vulnerability and need assessment of wetlands using remote sensing, GIS, and econometric models","Flash flood vulnerability mapping and livelihood vulnerability assessment are often considered essential elements of risk reduction strategies and act as indispensable initiatives. In line with the contention, an effort has been made to restrict flash flood vulnerability mapping and need assessment based on vulnerability classification at haor regions in Bangladesh using satellite remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and econometric models. First, flash flood vulnerability mapping was performed using a bivariate statistical regression-based frequency ratio (FR) model. The vulnerability mapping results revealed that wetlands from land use land cover (LULC), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) (>0.65–0.94), drainage density (>0.0166–0.0219 m/m2), flooding depth (2.61–3.40 m), and rainfall (2243–2619 mm/6 months) have significant roles in flash floods occurring with selected factor weight values of 2.241, 1.935, 1.576, 1.391 and 1.032, respectively. Moreover, the outputs of vulnerability mapping were classified into very high (7.57%), high (22.56%), moderate (56.96%), low (12.34%), and very low (0.56%), covering areas of 1303.0, 3882.0, 9801.0, 2124.0 and 96.0 km2, respectively. Second, 40 sampled respondents from each vulnerable groups were interviewed to assess their vulnerability and coping strategies against flash floods using field survey data through the composite livelihood vulnerability index (CLVI). CLVI findings showed that the vulnerability differences among the five groups of respondents were relevant to vulnerability mapping and classification done in the remote sensing and GIS platform. The logit estimates explained that the age of the household head, household size, farming experience, educational status, occupation of the household head, farm size, proximity to the marketplace, and no. of earning members affect farmers' attitudes toward coping strategies at different levels significantly. Identifying the risk of a flash flood in providing farmers with accurate information, developing advanced risk management strategies, and providing agricultural credit and service provision, policymakers and research institutions may benefit from mapping and evaluating their livelihood vulnerability on a single platform.

Spatio-temporal fluctuations analysis of land surface temperature (LST) using Remote Sensing data (LANDSAT TM5/8) and multifractal technique to characterize the …,"Accurate estimation of the microenvironment and radiative susceptibility, as well as forecasting of climate and weather scenarios in urban contexts, are critical for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Rapid urbanization has a substantial impact on both the local and global atmosphere, resulting in Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). This study is the first to attempt to analyze spatiotemporal space-borne sensor datasets in the Indian Himalayan foothills using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA). The coefficients derived through MDFA such as holder exponent (h), spectral width (α), irregularity, truncation spectra, and spatial distribution are analyzed for various land features to illustrate the dynamic patterns and corroborate the multifractality behavior of the land surface temperature (LST). The negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) suggests that vegetated land can assist to mitigate the effects of UHIs, whereas the positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) suggests that urbanization can aggravate the effects of UHIs. The obtained result encourages to implementation of the suggested framework to address anthropogenic heat and the transportation of surface heat fluxes, as well as empowers to work on non-linear dynamic climate models, which are critical for building real-time resilient infrastructure to meet environmental sustainability."
Assessing the recent trends of land degradation and desertification in Romania using remote sensing indicators,"Land degradation (LD) and desertification (DS) are a sensitive global issue including southern and south-eastern Europe, which is severely affected by climate change. In this study, a state-of-the-art approach for assessing the intensity of LD and DS processes using remote-sensing-derived indicators within a GIS environment was proposed. The analysis was carried out using the Principal Component Analysis based on integrating the significant trends of relevant biophysical parameters in Romania. The methodology was tested and validated at the national level in Romania. In total, 7.76% of the area was identified as LD and 60.8% of the total area tended to improve, and 31.44% was stable. Most of the regions with LD overlapped with the dryland areas, while improvement areas were identified outside of the drylands. In forested areas from high altitudes, a tendency to improve the condition of vegetation was observed, and most of the surfaces being protected were natural areas that have benefited from proper management. All these results can be used to adapt management practices to avoid, reduce, or restore the LD. The proposed model was based on globally available remote sensing datasets, with a high frequency of data acquisition and collection history that allows for the statistical analyses of changes on a global scale."
Bathymetric mapping and estimation of water storage in a shallow lake using a remote sensing inversion method based on machine learning,"Accurate lake depth mapping and estimation of changes in water level and water storage are fundamental significance for understanding the lake water resources on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, combined with satellite images and bathymetric data, we comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of a multi-factor combined linear regression model (MLR) and machine learning models, create a depth distribution map and compare it with the spatial interpolation, and estimate the change of water level and water storage based on the inverted depth. The results indicated that the precision of the random forest (RF) was the highest with a coefficient of determination (R2) value (0.9311) and mean absolute error (MAE) values (1.13 m) in the test dataset and had high reliability in the overall depth distribution. The water level increased by 9.36 m at a rate of 0.47 m/y, and the water storage increased by 1.811 km3 from 1998 to 2018 based on inversion depth. The water level change was consistent with that of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) method. Our work shows that this method may be employed to study the water depth distribution and its changes by combining with bathymetric data and satellite imagery in shallow lakes.

Monitoring and evaluation Al-Razzaza lake changes in Iraq using GIS and remote sensing technology,"This study uses remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems GIS to monitor and evaluate the changes in the shoreline and the surface water area of Al-Razzazah Lake in Iraq from the year 1989 until 2020. Based on six satellite Landsat images of the study area for the years 1989, 1999, 2002, 2015, 2019, and 2020, changes were evaluated and mapped. Two methods; Support Vector Machine SVM and ISO cluster classifiers have been used to classify and extract the surface water area. The results showed the great change and the heavy loss that this lake was exposed until the year 2019. The surface water area decreased by 84.1% from 1631.72 km2 in 1989 to 259.65 km2 in 2019. Also, the shoreline was decreased by 63.4% from 451.98 km in 1989 to 165.46 km in 2019. Most changes happened in the north part and east part of the lake. Otherwise, an increase in the surface area of the lake was observed in the year 2020. This indicates the lake's recovery again, which forces the responsible authorities to take the necessary management to maintain the lake's continuity and prevent drought. The retraction ratio of the shoreline and surface water area of Al-Razzazah Lake was in ascending values from the year 1989 up to 2019 at an extreme rate. This retraction negatively affects Iraq; socially, economically, and environmentally alike. It determines the quantity available to the lake and its default age.

Predicting the settlement of mine waste dump using multi-source remote sensing and a secondary consolidation model,"The settlement (or subsidence) of mine waste dump is likely to cause landslides, thereby imposing threats on the safety of human beings and other local properties. Hence, it is essential to accurately predict the settlement for the early-warning of settlement-induced geohazards. Traditional mechanical methods require in situ mechanical parameters and the geological structure of mine waste dump, narrowing their practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a remote sensing-based method for predicting the settlement of mine waste dump without the requirement for field observations. Firstly, the historical settlement and thickness of mine waste dump were measured by space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and photogrammetry techniques, respectively. Secondly, the temporal evolution of the settlement of mine waste dump was described by a secondary consolidation model. Thirdly, the parameters of the secondary consolidation model were inverted based on the InSAR-measured historical settlements and photogrammetry-estimated thickness. Finally, the evolution trend of the settlement of the mine waste dump was predicted with the secondary consolidation model and its inverted parameters. The proposed method was tested over a mine waste dump in Weijiamao open-pit mine, China. The result shows that the root mean square error of the predicted time-series settlement is about 0.8 cm. The presented method will be beneficial to the assessment and early-warning of the settlement-related geohazards of mine waste dumps over a large area.

A review of multi-sensor fusion slam systems based on 3D LIDAR,"The ability of intelligent unmanned platforms to achieve autonomous navigation and positioning in a large-scale environment has become increasingly demanding, in which LIDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the mainstream of research schemes. However, the LIDAR-based SLAM system will degenerate and affect the localization and mapping effects in extreme environments with high dynamics or sparse features. In recent years, a large number of LIDAR-based multi-sensor fusion SLAM works have emerged in order to obtain a more stable and robust system. In this work, the development process of LIDAR-based multi-sensor fusion SLAM and the latest research work are highlighted. After summarizing the basic idea of SLAM and the necessity of multi-sensor fusion, this paper introduces the basic principles and recent work of multi-sensor fusion in detail from four aspects based on the types of fused sensors and data coupling methods. Meanwhile, we review some SLAM datasets and compare the performance of five open-source algorithms using the UrbanNav dataset. Finally, the development trend and popular research directions of SLAM based on 3D LIDAR multi-sensor fusion are discussed and summarized."
Global and local contrastive self-supervised learning for semantic segmentation of HR remote sensing images,"Recently, supervised deep learning has achieved a great success in remote sensing image (RSI) semantic segmentation. However, supervised learning for semantic segmentation requires a large number of labeled samples, which is difficult to obtain in the field of remote sensing. A new learning paradigm, self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve such problems by pretraining a general model with a large number of unlabeled images and then fine-tuning it on a downstream task with very few labeled samples. Contrastive learning is a typical method of SSL that can learn general invariant features. However, most existing contrastive learning methods are designed for classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation, which may be suboptimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level discrimination. Therefore, we propose a global style and local matching contrastive learning network (GLCNet) for RSI semantic segmentation. Specifically, first, the global style contrastive learning module is used to better learn an image-level representation, as we consider that style features can better represent the overall image features. Next, the local features matching the contrastive learning module is designed to learn the representations of local regions, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation. We evaluate four RSI semantic segmentation datasets, and the experimental results show that our method mostly outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pretraining method. Specifically, with 1% annotation from the original dataset, our approach improves Kappa by 6% on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our method outperforms supervised learning methods when there are some differences between the datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks. Our study promotes the development of SSL in the field of RSI semantic segmentation. Sin..."
Remote sensing of floral resources for pollinators–new horizons from satellites to drones,"Insect pollinators are affected by the spatio-temporal distribution of floral resources, which are dynamic across time and space, and also influenced heavily by anthropogenic activities. There is a need for spatial data describing the time-varying spatial distribution of flowers, which can be used within behavioral and ecological studies. However, this information is challenging to obtain. Traditional field techniques for mapping flowers are often laborious and limited to relatively small areas, making it difficult to assess how floral resources are perceived by pollinators to guide their behaviors. Conversely, remote sensing of plant traits is a relatively mature technique now, and such technologies have delivered valuable data for identifying and measuring non-floral dynamics in plant systems, particularly leaves, stems and woody biomass in a wide range of ecosystems from local to global scales. However, monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant floral resources has been notably scarce in remote sensing studies. Recently, lightweight drone technology has been adopted by the ecological community, offering a capability for flexible deployment in the field, and delivery of centimetric resolution data, providing a clear opportunity for capturing fine-grained information on floral resources at key times of the flowering season. In this review, we answer three key questions of relevance to pollination science – can remote sensing deliver information on (a) how isolated are floral resources? (b) What resources are available within a flower patch? And (c) how do floral patches change over time? We explain how such information has potential to deepen ecological understanding of the distribution of floral resources that feed pollinators and the parameters that determine their navigational and foraging choices based on the sensory information they extract at different spatial scales. We provide examples of how such data can be used to generate new insights into pollinator behaviors in distinct landscape types and their resilience to environmental change.

Discovering inclusivity in remote sensing: Leaving no one behind,"Innovative and beneficial science stems from diverse teams and authorships that are inclusive of many perspectives. In this paper, we explore the status of inclusivity in remote sensing academic publishing, using an audit of peer-reviewed journal editorial board composition. Our findings demonstrate diversity deficiency in gender and country of residence, limiting the majority of editors to men residing in four countries. We also examine the many challenges underrepresented communities within our field face, such as implicit bias, harsher reviews, and fewer citations. We assert that in the field of remote sensing, the gatekeepers are not representative of the global society and this lack of representation restricts what research is valued and published, and ultimately who becomes successful. We present an action plan to help make the field of remote sensing more diverse and inclusive and urge every individual to consider their role as editor, author, reviewer, or reader. We believe that each of us have a choice to continue to align with a journal/institution/society that is representative of the dynamic state of our field and its people, ensuring that no one is left behind while discovering all the fascinating possibilities in remote sensing.

A review of earth observation-based drought studies in Southeast Asia,"Drought is a recurring natural climatic hazard event over terrestrial land; it poses devastating threats to human health, the economy, and the environment. Given the increasing climate crisis, it is likely that extreme drought phenomena will become more frequent, and their impacts will probably be more devastating. Drought observations from space, therefore, play a key role in dissimilating timely and accurate information to support early warning drought management and mitigation planning, particularly in sparse in-situ data regions. In this paper, we reviewed drought-related studies based on Earth observation (EO) products in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2021. The results of this review indicated that drought publications in the region are on the increase, with a majority (70%) of the studies being undertaken in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. These countries also accounted for nearly 97% of the economic losses due to drought extremes. Vegetation indices from multispectral optical remote sensing sensors remained a primary source of data for drought monitoring in the region. Many studies (~21%) did not provide accuracy assessment on drought mapping products, while precipitation was the main data source for validation. We observed a positive association between spatial extent and spatial resolution, suggesting that nearly 81% of the articles focused on the local and national scales. Although there was an increase in drought research interest in the region, challenges remain regarding large-area and long time-series drought measurements, the combined drought approach, machine learning-based drought prediction, and the integration of multi-sensor remote sensing products (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2). Satellite EO data could be a substantial part of the future efforts that are necessary for mitigating drought-related challenges, ensuring food security, establishing a more sustainable economy, and the preservation of the natural environment in the region."
Land degradation trend in the climatic types of Fars province using remote sensing and climatic variables,"Land degradation rapidly increased in developing countries. Changes in climate and land use in Fars province in the past few decades have intensified the process of destruction and desertification. In the present research, satellite data was used to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of vegetation and its relationship with climate changes in the climate samples of Fars province in the years 2000 to 2020. The trend of changes of these variables in time with the Mann-Kendall method and in determining the time of change and spatial correlation, Pettit's test and Pearson's correlation test were used, respectively. The trend of NDVI in arid and semi-arid climates is increasing and the point of change is from 2010 onwards. Based on this, it can be expected that in most regions of Fars, we see a decrease in the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation (increase in evaporation) and the decadence trend is increasing. Precipitation has no trend and the surface temperature is decreasing. The spatial pattern of NDVI and precipitation trend is increasing in more than 70% of the region (south), and AI and LST are decreasing in more than 65% of the region (central). NDVI changes spatial correlation with LST, precipitation and AI variables showed that the type of relationship and the strength of correlation were different in climatic regions. The strongest correlations were seen in the cold ultra-arid climates in the northeast and the temperate Mediterranean located in the northwest of the province."
Remoteclip: A vision language foundation model for remote sensing,"General-purpose foundation models have led to recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). In remote sensing, self-supervised learning (SSL) and masked image modeling (MIM) have been adopted to build foundation models. However, these models primarily learn low-level features and require annotated data for fine-tuning. Moreover, they are inapplicable for retrieval and zero-shot applications due to the lack of language understanding. To address these limitations, we propose RemoteCLIP, the first vision-language foundation model for remote sensing that aims to learn robust visual features with rich semantics and aligned text embeddings for seamless downstream application. To address the scarcity of pretraining data, we leverage data scaling which converts heterogeneous annotations into a unified image-caption data format based on box-to-caption (B2C) and mask-to-box (M2B) conversion. By further incorporating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, we produce a 12× larger pretraining dataset than the combination of all available datasets. RemoteCLIP can be applied to a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification, linear probing, k-NN classification, few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and object counting in remote sensing images. Evaluation of 16 datasets, including a newly introduced RemoteCount benchmark to test the object counting ability, shows that RemoteCLIP consistently outperforms baseline foundation models across different model scales. Impressively, RemoteCLIP beats the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 9.14% mean recall on the RSITMD dataset and 8.92% on the RSICD dataset. For zero-shot classification, our RemoteCLIP outperforms the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) baseline by up to 6.39% average accuracy on 12 downstream datasets."
UIEGAN: Adversarial Learning-based Photo-realistic Image Enhancement for Intelligent Underwater Environment Perception,"Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is an essential task for intelligent environment perception in underwater remote visual sensing scenarios. However, the computing power of mobile platforms limits the usage of larger scale models. In this article, we propose a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture [UIE network (UIENet)] to enhance underwater images from visual sensors. We also involve the architecture into a generative adversarial network (UIEGAN) model against a supervised discriminator to further perfect its corrective capabilities for the photorealistic images with more global appearance and local details. The multiresolution counterparts are embedded into the generator to diversify the feature representation of the original inputs. Further, UIEGAN guides the spatial attention module (SAM) and the channel attention module (CAM) to jointly enhance the global-local connection of the image. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets of UIEB and UFO-120 and report better performance than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schemes, exceeding 15.43% and 12.85% on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) than the baselines of these datasets. Besides, by testing on the UIEB challenge, URPC and SQUID datasets without any reference images, our scheme outperforms the other methods on evaluation metrics to validate its generalization performance, and meanwhile uses a series of ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the functional modules."
Advancements in the satellite sensing of the impacts of climate and variability on bush encroachment in savannah rangelands,"An increase in shrubs or woody species is likely, directly or indirectly, to significantly affect rural livelihoods, wildlife/livestock productivity and conservation efforts. Poor and inappropriate land use management practices have resulted in rangeland degradation, particularly in semi-arid regions, and this has amplified the bush encroachment rate in many African countries, particularly in key savannah rangelands. The rate of encroachment is also perceived to be connected to other environmental factors, such as climate change, fire and rainfall variability, which may influence the structure and density of the shrubs (woody plants), when compared to uncontrolled grazing. Remote sensing has provided robust data for global studies on both bush encroachment and climate variability over multiple decades, and these data have complemented the local and regional evidence and process studies. This paper thus provides a detailed review of the advancements in the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of bush encroachment on the African continent, which is fuelled by climate variability in the rangeland areas. An understanding of how bush encroachment is fuelled by climate variability and change, as well as its impact on rangelands in the semi-arid areas, is still limited due to the scanty and, at times, fragmented research, especially when it comes to using remote sensing technology. This study also highlights the scientific knowledge gap that exists regarding the impact of climate variability on rangelands, which has yet to be explored by using remotely-sensed data. From a remote sensing viewpoint, rangeland monitoring is challenging when it comes to discriminating between the different herbaceous layers and implementing management practices. Overall, this review emphasizes the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in tracking the impact of climate change on savannah rangelands.
