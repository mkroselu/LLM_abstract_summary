A review of remote sensing for environmental monitoring in China,"The natural environment is essential for human survival and development since it provides water resources, land resources, biological resources and climate resources etc. As a developing country, China has witnessed a significant change in the natural environment in recent decades; and therefore, monitoring and mastering the status of the environment is of great significance. Due to the characteristics of large-scale and dynamic observation, remote sensing technology has been an indispensable approach for environmental monitoring. This paper reviews the satellite resources, institutions and policies for environmental monitoring in China, and the advances in research and application of remote sensing from five aspects: ecological index retrieval, environmental monitoring in protected areas, rural areas, urban areas and mining areas. The remote sensing models and methods for various types of environmental monitoring, and the specific applications in China are comprehensively summarized. This paper also points out major challenges existing at the current stage: satellite sensor problems, integrated use challenges of datasets, uncertainty in the retrieval process of ecological variables, scaling effect problems, a low degree of automation, the weak ability of forecasting and comprehensive analysis, and a lack of computational power for massive datasets. Finally, the development trend and future directions are put forward to direct the research and application of environmental monitoring and protection in the new era."

Deep learning in environmental remote sensing: Achievements and challenges,"Various forms of machine learning (ML) methods have historically played a valuable role in environmental
remote sensing research. With an increasing amount of “big data” from earth observation and rapid advances in
ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over
the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from
the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in
performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has
been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to
advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing,
including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information
reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward,
the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface
temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges
and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed."
Remote sensing for agricultural applications: A meta-review,"Agriculture provides humanity with food, fibers, fuel, and raw materials that are paramount for human livelihood. Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications."
Remote sensing of shallow waters–A 50 year retrospective and future directions,"Technical advancements have widened the limits of remote sensing in mapping shallow water benthic habitats and bathymetry over the last decades. On the other hand, the needs of shallow water remote sensing have pushed instrument development. In this manuscript we provide 50-year retrospective of the developments in the field in terms of both instrumentation and methods. We also show that spectral features characteristic of the main benthic groups in shallow water are consistent from the tropics to sub-arctic regions and from salty to freshwaters. The fundamental limiting factor in both benthic mapping and bathymetry is absorption of light by water molecules. However, spectral absorption by water molecules is the key to bathymetry derivation. Variable backscattering by particles and absorption by dissolved organic matter is a confounding factor for all objectives. The combination of using the spectral and textural characteristics of bottom features and our knowledge about these features have now resulted in the ability to map habitats over large coastal systems. This manuscript has shown that optically shallow water remote sensing has reached levels where the satellite derived bathymetry and habitat maps are accepted by different end users (including the International Maritime Organisation) and are routinely used in ecological studies, monitoring and management of coastal environments."
Survey on Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change analysis in remote sensing and GIS environment: Techniques and Challenges,"The surface of the earth is rapidly changing every day due to certain natural reasons and other impacts by society. Over the last few decades, the hottest topics in the field of remote sensing and GIS (geographic information system) environments have evolved from observing the nature of the earth. Owing to the enlargement of several worldwide modifications related to the nature of the earth, land use/land cover (LU/LC) change is considered as the matter of utmost importance in the natural atmosphere, and it has also become an interesting area to be studied by the researchers. As there is a lack of review articles in the land use/land cover change analysis process, we presented a comprehensive review which may help the researchers to proceed further. This paper deals with the most frequent methods used by researchers on various processes like pre-processing, classification, and prediction of time series satellite images for analyzing the LU/LC changes using satellite images. The generic flow of the LU/LC change analysis process and the challenges faced during each process by the researchers are discussed. Varied resolutions of the environmental image captured by remote sensing satellites for analyzing the LU/LC changes are discussed. Various LU/LC classes depending on change in the earth’s surface are also studied and the constraint used in each application is stated. The importance of this review lies in the motivation for future researchers to work on the LU/LC change analysis problem effectively."
Transitioning from change detection to monitoring with remote sensing: A paradigm shift,"The use of time series analysis with moderate resolution satellite imagery is increasingly common, particularly since the advent of freely available Landsat data. Dense time series analysis is providing new information on the timing of landscape changes, as well as improving the quality and accuracy of information being derived from remote sensing. Perhaps most importantly, time series analysis is expanding the kinds of land surface change that can be monitored using remote sensing. In particular, more subtle changes in ecosystem health and condition and related to land use dynamics are being monitored. The result is a paradigm shift away from change detection, typically using two points in time, to monitoring, or an attempt to track change continuously in time. This trend holds many benefits, including the promise of near real-time monitoring. Anticipated future trends include more use of multiple sensors in monitoring activities, increased focus on the temporal accuracy of results, applications over larger areas and operational usage of time series analysis."
Remote sensing of night lights: A review and an outlook for the future,"Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to
38 directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications
39 including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and
40 conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in
41 understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including
42 their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of
43 night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various
44 applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote
45 sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an
46 outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on
47 space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on
48 astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of
49 space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags
50 behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development.
51 The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of
52 night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night
53 lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal
54 changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of
55 satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly
56 analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case
57 that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to
58 NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions,
59 and monitor energy use."
Monitoring the urban environment quality in the city of Johannesburg using remote sensing data,"Quantification and analysis of urban greenness is important in evaluating the role of urban trees in carbon sequestration and regulating land surface temperature of an urban environment. Landsat 8 satellite data was used to evaluate the effects of urban heat island based on land surface temperature (LST) in the affluent suburb of Rosebank in the north and the previously marginalized township of Soweto south of Johannesburg. It was found that the LST of Soweto was 2.58 °C hotter than Rosebank, suggesting that high-density areas with less street trees and parks are hotter than low-density suburbs. The Pearson's correlation coefficient computed between the LST and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the two areas, Rosebank and Soweto showed a positive correlation of 0.92 and 0.98) and a negative correlation of −0.91 and −0.99 respectively. The correlation between the NDVI and NDBI also showed negative values of −0.90 and −0.85, respectively. Based on the global bench mark for safe solar UVI, the residents of Soweto are likely to be at risk of skin and eye damage due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation than the residents of Rosebank. Thus, this study has effectively computed and evaluated the land surface temperatures of the two study areas from Landsat 8 satellite data, an information which can help potential vegetation cover programs to improve existing disparity in urban greenness in the city of Johannesburg."
"Remote sensing: Principles, interpretation, and applications","Remote sensing has undergone profound changes over the past two decades as GPS, GIS, and sensor advances have significantly expanded the user community and availability of images. New tools, such as automation, cloud-based services, drones, and artificial intelligence, continue to expand and enhance the discipline. Along with comprehensive coverage and clarity, Sabins and Ellis establish a solid foundation for the insightful use of remote sensing with an emphasis on principles and a focus on sensor technology and image acquisition.

The authors explain the scientific and societal impacts of remote sensing, review digital image processing and GIS, provide case histories from areas around the globe, and describe practical applications of remote sensing to the environment, renewable and nonrenewable resources, land use/land cover, natural hazards, and climate change."
"National wetland mapping using remote-sensing-derived environmental variables, archive field data, and artificial intelligence","While wetland ecosystem services are widely recognized, the lack of fine-scale national inventories prevents successful implementation of conservation policies. Wetlands are difficult to map due to their complex fine-grained spatial pattern and fuzzy boundaries. However, the increasing amount of open high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and accurately georeferenced field data archives, as well as progress in artificial intelligence (AI), provide opportunities for fine-scale national wetland mapping. The objective of this study was to map wetlands over mainland France (ca. 550,000 km2 ) by applying AI to environmental variables derived from remote sensing and archive field data. A random forest model was calibrated using spatial crossvalidation according to the precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) index using ca. 135,000 soil or flora plots from archive databases, as well as 5 m topographical variables derived from an airborne DTM and a geological map. The model was validated using an experimentally designed sampling strategy with ca. 3000 plots collected during a ground survey in 2021 along non-wetland/wetland transects. Map accuracy was then compared to those of nine existing wetland maps with global, European, or national coverage. The model-derived suitability map (PR-AUC 0.76) highlights the gradual boundaries and fine-grained pattern of wetlands. The binary map is significantly more accurate (F1-score 0.75, overall accuracy 0.67) than existing wetland maps. The approach and end-results are of important value for spatial planning and environmental management since the high-resolution suitability and binary maps enable more targeted conservation measures to support biodiversity conservation, water resources maintenance, and carbon storage."
"Multi-sensor remote sensing for drought characterization: current status, opportunities and a roadmap for the future","Satellite based remote sensing offers one of the few approaches able to monitor the spatial and temporal development of regional to continental scale droughts. A unique element of remote sensing platforms is their multi-sensor capability, which enhances the capacity for characterizing drought from a variety of perspectives. Such aspects include monitoring drought influences on vegetation and hydrological responses, as well as assessing sectoral impacts (e.g., agriculture). With advances in remote sensing systems along with an increasing range of platforms available for analysis, this contribution provides a timely and systematic review of multi-sensor remote sensing drought studies, with a particular focus on drought related datasets, drought related phenomena and mechanisms, and drought modeling. To explore this topic, we first present a comprehensive summary of large-scale remote sensing datasets that can be used for multi-sensor drought studies. We then review the role of multi-sensor remote sensing for exploring key drought related phenomena and mechanisms, including vegetation responses to drought, land-atmospheric feedbacks during drought, drought-induced tree mortality, drought-related ecosystem fires, post-drought recovery and legacy effects, flash drought, as well as drought trends under climate change. A summary of recent modeling advances towards developing integrated multi-sensor remote sensing drought indices is also provided. We conclude that leveraging multi-sensor remote sensing provides unique benefits for regional to global drought studies, particularly in: 1) revealing the complex drought impact mechanisms on ecosystem components; 2) providing continuous long-term drought related information at large scales; 3) presenting real-time drought information with high spatiotemporal resolution; 4) providing multiple lines of evidence of drought monitoring to improve modeling and prediction robustness; and 5) improving the accuracy of drought monitoring and assessment efforts. We specifically highlight that more mechanism-oriented drought studies that leverage a combination of sensors and techniques (e.g., optical, microwave, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and constellations) across a range of spatiotemporal scales are needed in order to progress and advance our understanding, characterization and description of drought in the future."
Coupling coordination analysis of urbanization and eco-environment in Yanqi Basin based on multi-source remote sensing data,"While multi-source remote sensing technology has the advantage of accurate and objective quantification, an understanding of the coupling and coordination between regional urbanization and ecological environment is the basis for achieving regional sustainable development. This paper builds the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) based on Landsat data and Tiangong-2 WIS, using multi-source remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate the coupling and coordination relationship between urbanization and ecological environment with a coupling coordination degree model in China's typical arid area of Yanqin Basin during 2000–2018. The results show the RSEI index has a certain rationality and superiority in assessing the ecological environment. In 2000–2018, the ecological environment of the Yanqi Basin was optimized, the RSEI index increased by 23.06%, and the overall ecological environment was at a good level (0.6–0.8). At the same time, the urbanization level of each town had been significantly improved in Yanqi Basin. Through the urban center of gravity transfer model, it was found that direction of urban development shifted to the southwest direction by 7.49 km, which is basically consistent with the position of poor ecological environment. Finally the current urbanization and ecological environment coupling relationship in urban areas of Yanqi Basin was found to exhibit a sluggish rate of urbanization with a moderate imbalance between urbanization with ecological environment. Therefore, when making decisions for planning the regional economic development, the concept of ecological relationships should be integrated to effectively protect and achieve a healthy and sustainable development of the region."
Introduction to the physics and techniques of remote sensing,"The science and engineering of remote sensing--theory and applications
The Second Edition of this authoritative book offers readers the essential science and engineering foundation needed to understand remote sensing and apply it in real-world situations. Thoroughly updated to reflect the tremendous technological leaps made since the publication of the first edition, this book covers the gamut of knowledge and skills needed to work in this dynamic field, including:
* Physics involved in wave-matter interaction, the building blocks for interpreting data
* Techniques used to collect data
* Remote sensing applications
The authors have carefully structured and organized the book to introduce readers to the basics, and then move on to more advanced applications. Following an introduction, Chapter 2 sets forth the basic properties of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with matter. Chapters 3 through 7 cover the use of remote sensing in solid surface studies, including oceans. Each chapter covers one major part of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., visible/near infrared, thermal infrared, passive microwave, and active microwave).
Chapters 8 through 12 then cover remote sensing in the study of atmospheres and ionospheres. Each chapter first presents the basic interaction mechanism, followed by techniques to acquire, measure, and study the information, or waves, emanating from the medium under investigation. In most cases, a specific advanced sensor is used for illustration.
The book is generously illustrated with fifty percent new figures. Numerous illustrations are reproduced in a separate section of color plates. Examples of data acquired from spaceborne sensors are included throughout. Finally, a set of exercises is provided.
This book is based on an upper-level undergraduate and first-year graduate course taught by the authors at the California Institute of Technology. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field and its applications, it is appropriate for students in electrical engineering, applied physics, geology, planetary science, astronomy, and aeronautics. It is also recommended for any engineer or scientist interested in working in this exciting field."
Monitoring the effects of open-pit mining on the eco-environment using a moving window-based remote sensing ecological index,"Environmental problems caused by mines have been increasing. As one of the most serious types of mining damage caused to the eco-environment, open pits have been the focus of monitoring and management. Previous studies have obtained effective results when evaluating the ecological quality of a mining area by using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). However, the calculation of RSEI does not consider that the ecological environmental impact is limited under natural conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved RSEI based on a moving window model, namely the moving window-based remote sensing ecological index (MW-RSEI). This improved index is more in agreement with the First Law of Geography than RSEI. This study uses Landsat ETM/OLI/TIRS images to extract MW-RSEI information of a case area in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, central China, in 2009 and 2018. The results revealed that the average value of MW-RSEI declined from 0.668 to 0.611 from 2009 to 2018, and the main drivers of the deterioration of the eco-environment were land use/cover (LUCC) changes, most of which were derived from urban expansion and mining. The serious impact of open pits on the eco-environment in mining areas is mainly due to their low vegetation cover; therefore, some effectively managed open pits can have a positive impact on the mining environment. The use of MW-RSEI provides valuable information on the eco-environment surrounding the open pit, which can be used for the rapid and effective monitoring of the eco-environment in mining areas."
Land-cover classification with high-resolution remote sensing images using transferable deep models,"In recent years, large amount of high spatial-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images are available for land-cover mapping. However, due to the complex information brought by the increased spatial resolution and the data disturbances caused by different conditions of image acquisition, it is often difficult to find an efficient method for achieving accurate land-cover classification with high-resolution and heterogeneous remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a scheme to apply deep model obtained from labeled land-cover dataset to classify unlabeled HRRS images. The main idea is to rely on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained in different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample selection scheme for improving the transferability of deep models. More precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is first pre-trained with a well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data. Then, given a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to classify the image in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are assigned with pseudo-labels and employed as the queries to retrieve related samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with the retrieved results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target image, we rely on the fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by combining patch-wise classification and hierarchical segmentation. In addition, we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing 150 Gaofen-2 satellite images for CNN pre-training. Experiments on multi-source HRRS images, including Gaofen-2, Gaofen-1, Jilin-1, Ziyuan-3, Sentinel-2A, and Google Earth platform data, show encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to land-cover classification with multi-source HRRS images."
"Satellite remote sensing of active fires: History and current status, applications and future requirements","Landscape fire is a widespread, somewhat unpredictable phenomena that plays an important part in Earth's biogeochemical cycling. In many biomes worldwide fire also provides multiple ecological benefits, but in certain circumstances can also pose a risk to life and infrastructure, lead to net increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and to degradation in air quality and consequently human health. Accurate, timely and frequently updated information on landscape fire activity is essential to improve our understanding of the drivers and impacts of this form of biomass burning, as well as to aid fire management. This information can only be provided using satellite Earth Observation (EO) approaches, and remote sensing of active fire is one of the key techniques used. This form of EO is based on detecting the signature of the (mostly infrared) electromagnetic radiation emitted as biomass burns. Since the early 1980's, active fire (AF) remote sensing conducted using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has been deployed in certain regions of the world to map the location and timing of landscape fire occurrence, and from the early 2000's global-scale information updated multiple times per day has been easily available to all. Geostationary (GEO) satellites provide even higher frequency AF information, more than 100 times per day in some cases, and both LEO- and GEO-derived AF products now often include estimates of a fires characteristics, such as its fire radiative power (FRP) output, in addition to the fires detection. AF data provide information relevant to fire activity ongoing when the EO data were collected, and this can be delivered with very low latency times to support applications such as air quality forecasting. Here we summarize the history of achievements in the field of active fire remote sensing, review the physical basis of the approaches used, the nature of the AF detection and characterization techniques deployed, and highlight some of the key current capabilities and applications. Finally, we list some important developments we believe deserve focus in future years."
Monitoring biodiversity in the Anthropocene using remote sensing in species distribution models,"In the face of the growing challenges brought about by human activities, effective planning and 77 decision-making in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable 4 78 development are urgently needed. Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need 79 and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on 80 land and under water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 14 & 15). The 81 urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), 82 for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re83 envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of 84 biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action. 85 A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes 86 arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community to 87 achieve a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing 88 data products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key 89 factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of 90 these models for management and planning. 91 Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological 92 modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We 93 specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the 94 Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbance. We then 95 discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, 96 and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more 97 effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. 98 Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead 99 to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas such as the Agenda 2030 for 100 sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework 101 of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management 102 strategies towards sustainability.

Remote sensing digital image analysis,"Remote Sensing Digital Image Analysis provides a comprehensive treatment of the methods used for the processing and interpretation of remotely sensed image data.  Over the past decade there have been continuing and significant developments in the algorithms used for the analysis of remote sensing imagery, even though many of the fundamentals have substantially remained the same.  As with its predecessors this new edition again presents material that has retained value but also includes newer techniques, covered from the perspective of operational remote sensing.

The book is designed as a teaching text for the senior undergraduate and postgraduate student, and as a fundamental treatment for those engaged in research using digital image analysis in remote sensing.  The presentation level is for the mathematical non-specialist.  Since the very great number of operational users of remote sensing come from the earth sciences communities, the text is pitched at a level commensurate with their background.  

The chapters progress logically through means for the acquisition of remote sensing images, techniques by which they can be corrected, and methods for their interpretation. The prime focus is on applications of the methods, so that worked examples are included and a set of problems conclude each chapter."
A remote sensing approach to mapping fire severity in south-eastern Australia using sentinel 2 and random forest,"Accurate and consistent broad-scale mapping of fire severity is an important resource for fire management as well as fire-related ecological and climate change research. Remote sensing and machine learning approaches present an opportunity to enhance accuracy and efficiency of current practices. Quantitative biophysical models of photosynthetic, non-photosynthetic and bare cover fractions have not been widely applied to fire severity studies but may provide greater consistency in comparisons of different fires across the landscape compared to reflectance-based indices. We systematically tested and compared reflectance and fractional cover candidate severity indices derived from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery using a random forest (RF) machine learning framework. Assessment of predictive power (cross-validation) was undertaken to quantify the accuracy of mapping severity of new fires. The effect of environmental variables on the accuracy of the RF predicted severity classification was examined to assess the stability of the mapping across the landscape. The results indicate that fire severity can be mapped with very high accuracy using Sentinel 2 imagery and RF supervised classification. The mean accuracy was >95% for the unburnt and extreme severity class (complete crown consumption), >85% for high severity class (full crown scorch), >80% for low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy) and >70% for the moderate severity class (partial canopy scorch). Higher canopy cover and higher topographic complexity was associated with a higher rate of under-prediction, due to the limitations of optical sensors in viewing the burnt understorey of low severity classes under these conditions. Further research is aimed at improving classification accuracy of low and moderate severity classes and applying the RF algorithm to hazard reduction fires."
Deep building footprint update network: A semi-supervised method for updating existing building footprint from bi-temporal remote sensing images,"Building footprint information is one foundation for understanding urban processes and hence a program for environmentally sustainable urbanization. For most cities, municipal governments have constructed basic building contour databases for basic land resource management and urban planning. These building contour databases, however, need to be updated regularly to ensure their validity. Cities are dynamic, changing rapidly over short periods, thus there is an urgent need for automatic methods to produce up-to-date building footprints. Even fully supervised automated methods have major limitations in the building footprint updating process because the labels for current buildings or changed areas are lacking. Moreover, state-of-the-art automatic schemes even some based on deep learning approaches, however, often fail to precisely depict building boundaries, jeopardizing effective updating of building databases. To address these interrelated problems, we developed a novel algorithm to automatically update the existing building databases to their current status with minimal manual intervention; the saliency-guided edge-preservation framework (named SG-EPUNet) for updating existing building databases and producing up-to-date building footprints. This neural network-based method can update building footprints from remote sensing images, requiring manual annotations for only 20% of the buildings. To robustly extract building features, we designed an edge-preservation neural network (EPUNet) that combines edge detection with contextual aggregation in the proposed SG-EPUNet framework. We applied the methods on two datasets from Christchurch, New Zealand, and Guangzhou, China, to assess the effectiveness of the method in urban and suburban areas. For both study areas, the F1-score values for the building update results reached approximately 97%, which confirmed the applicability of the SG-EPUNet framework. The results also show that SG-EPUNet maintains robustness to large areas, even with very limited ground truth labeling. The joint combination of building prior and very high-resolution remote sensing images makes the proposed method a promising approach for automatically producing up-to-date building footprints in practical applications. The source code of the proposed EPUNet and SG-EPUNet is publicly available at https://github.com/HaonanGuo/SG-EPUNet."
A review of machine learning in processing remote sensing data for mineral exploration,"The decline of the number of newly discovered mineral deposits and increase in demand for different minerals in recent years
has led exploration geologists to look for more efficient and innovative methods for processing different data types at each stage
of mineral exploration. As a primary step, various features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and indicator
minerals, are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing datasets, such as satellite
and airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated with mapping geological features. The rapid increase
in the volume of remote sensing data obtained from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop advanced, innovative,
and robust data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help process a wide range of remote sensing datasets
and determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum and features of interest. These methods are
robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been
carried out by supplementing geological surveys with remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research. This
paper provides a comprehensive review of the implementation and adaptation of some popular and recently established machine
learning methods for processing different types of remote sensing data and investigates their applications for detecting various ore
deposit types. We demonstrate the high capability of combining remote sensing data and machine learning methods for mapping
different geological features that are critical for providing potential maps. Moreover, we find there is scope for advanced methods

UAV-based remote sensing for the petroleum industry and environmental monitoring: State-of-the-art and perspectives,"An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), popularly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Recent developments in sensor technology and navigation systems have made drones a powerful and reliable basis for professional data acquisition. Today, the use of UAVs has expanded massively in the civil and commercial sectors and this technology has found its way into almost every industrial sector including the petroleum industry. Drone technology offers a great potential to revolutionize the mapping, monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures of the petroleum industry by providing a faster, safer, and more cost-efficient way of mass data collection. This article offers a review of the common UAV platforms and sensor systems and highlights the state-of-the-art and application examples of drone remote sensing in the oil and gas industry. Six broad areas are recognized comprising offshore oil spill detection, oil leakage detection, pipeline monitoring, gas emission sensing, remote facility inspection, petroleum exploration (i.e., land surveying, geologic mapping, and petroleum exploration), and environmental monitoring. Research gaps and open issues along with opportunities for further developments in each of these areas are highlighted."
Hyperlocal mapping of urban air temperature using remote sensing and crowdsourced weather data,"The impacts of climate change such as extreme heat waves are exacerbated in cities where most of the world's population live. Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10–30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 °C (R2 = 0.5), 1.85 °C (R2 = 0.05) and 1.46 °C (R2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with <250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km−2) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 °C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data. These maps can provide a complement to and validation of traditional urban canopy models and may assist in identifying hyperlocal hotspots and coldspots of relevance to urban planners."
Applications in remote sensing to forest ecology and management,"Remote sensing provides valuable insights into pressing environmental challenges and is a critical tool for
driving solutions. In this Primer, we briefly introduce the important role of remote sensing in forest ecology
and management, which includes applications as diverse as mapping the distribution of forest ecosystems
and characterizing the three-dimensional structure of forests. We describe six key reasons why remote
sensing has become an important data source and introduce the different types of sensors (e.g., multispectral and synthetic aperture radar) and platforms (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites) that have been
used for mapping a diversity of forest variables. The rapid advancement in remote-sensing technology, techniques, and platforms is likely to result in a greater democratization of remote-sensing data to support forest
management and conservation in parts of the world where environmental issues are the most urgent."
A practical reanalysis data and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging (RTM) method for reconstruction of a 1-km all-weather land surface temperature,"An all-weather land surface temperature (LST) dataset at moderate to high spatial resolutions (e.g. 1 km) has been in urgent need, especially in areas frequently covered in clouds (i.e. the Tibetan Plateau). Merging satellite thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) observations is a widely-adopted approach to derive such LST datasets, whereas the swath gap of the PMW data leads to considerable data deficiency or low reliability in the merged LST, especially at the low-mid latitudes. Fortunately, reanalyzed data provides the spatiotemporally continuous LST and thus, is promising to be merged with TIR data for reconstructing the all-weather LST without this issue. However, few studies along this direction have been reported. In this context, based on the decomposition model of LST time series, this study proposes a novel reanalysis and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging (RTM) method to reconstruct the 1-km all-weather LST. The method was applied to merge Aqua/Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global/China Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS/CLDAS) data over the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding area. Results show that the RTM LST has RMSEs of 2.03–3.98 K and coefficients of determination of 0.82–0.93 under all-weather conditions when validated against the ground measured LST. Besides, from comparison between RTM LST and current existing PMW-TIR merged LST, it is found the former LST efficiently outperforms the latter one in terms of accuracy and image quality, especially over the MW swath gap-covered area. In addition, compared to the MODIS-CLDAS merged all-weather LST based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), the two LSTs have comparable accuracy while the RTM LST has higher spatial completeness. The method is promising for generating a long-term all-weather LST record at moderate to high spatiotemporal resolutions at large scales, which would be beneficial to associated studies and applications."
Evolution of evapotranspiration models using thermal and shortwave remote sensing data,"Evapotranspiration (ET) from the land surface is an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle. Since the advent of Earth observation by satellites, various models have been developed to use thermal and shortwave remote sensing data for ET estimation. In this review, we provide a brief account of the key milestones in the history of remote sensing ET model development in two categories: temperature-based and conductance-based models. Temperature-based ET models utilize land surface temperature (LST) observed through thermal remote sensing to calculate the sensible heat flux from which ET is estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance or to estimate the evaporative fraction from which ET is derived from the available energy. Models of various complexities have been developed to estimate ET from surfaces of different vegetation fractions. One-source models combine soil and vegetation into a composite surface for ET estimation, while two-source models estimate ET of soil and vegetation components separately. Image contexture-based triangular and trapezoid models are simple and effective temperature-based ET models based on spatial and/or temporal variation patterns of LST. Several effective temporal scaling schemes are available for extending instantaneous temperature-based ET estimation to daily or longer time periods. Conductance-based ET models usually use the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation to estimate ET with shortwave remote sensing data. A key put to these models is canopy conductance to water vapor, which depends on canopy structure and leaf stomatal conductance. Shortwave remote sensing data are used to determine canopy structural parameters, and stomatal conductance can be estimated in different ways. Based on the principle of the coupling between carbon and water cycles, stomatal conductance can be reliably derived from the plant photosynthesis rate. Three types of photosynthesis models are available for deriving stomatal or canopy conductance: (1) big-leaf models for the total canopy conductance, (2) two-big-leaf models for canopy conductances for sunlit and shaded leaf groups, and (3) two-leaf models for stomatal conductances for the average sunlit and shaded leaves separately. Correspondingly, there are also big-leaf, two-big-leaf and two-leaf ET models based on these conductances. The main difference among them is the level of aggregation of conductances before the P-M equation is used for ET estimation, with big-leaf models having the highest aggregation. Since the relationship between ET and conductance is nonlinear, this aggregation causes negative bias errors, with the big-leaf models having the largest bias. It is apparent from the existing literature that two-leaf conductance-based ET models have the least bias in comparison with flux measurements. Based on this review, we make the following recommendations for future work: (1) improving key remote sensing products needed for ET mapping purposes, including soil moisture, foliage clumping index, and leaf carboxylation rate, (2) combining temperature-based and conductance-based models for regional ET estimation, (3) refining methodologies for tight coupling between carbon and water cycles, (4) fully utilizing vegetation structural and biochemical parameters that can now be reliably retrieved from shortwave remote sensing, and (5) to improve regional and global ET monitoring capacity."
"Deep learning-based air temperature mapping by fusing remote sensing, station, simulation and socioeconomic data","Air temperature (Ta) is an essential climatological component that controls and influences
various earth surface processes. In this study, we make the first attempt to employ deep
learning for Ta mapping mainly based on space remote sensing and ground station
observations. Considering that Ta varies greatly in space and time and is sensitive to many
factors, assimilation data and socioeconomic data are also included for a multi-source data
fusion based estimation. Specifically, a 5-layers structured deep belief network (DBN) is
employed to better capture the complicated and non-linear relationships between Ta and
different predictor variables. Layer-wise pre-training process for essential features extraction
and fine-tuning process for weight parameters optimization ensure the robust prediction of Ta
spatio-temporal distribution. The DBN model was implemented for 0.01°daily maximum Ta
mapping across China. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicate that the DBN model
achieves promising results with the RMSE of 1.996°C, MAE of 1.539°C, and R of 0.986 at
the national scale. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), back-propagation neural
2
network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) method, the DBN model reduces the MAE values
by 1.340°C, 0.387°C and 0.222°C, respectively. Further analysis on spatial distribution and
temporal tendency of prediction errors both validate the great potentials of DBN in Ta
estimation."
Accurate cloud detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery by weakly supervised deep learning,"Cloud cover is a common and inevitable phenomenon that often hinders the usability of optical remote sensing (RS) image data and further interferes with continuous cartography based on RS image interpretation. In the literature, the off-the-shelf cloud detection methods either require various hand-crafted features or utilize data-driven features using deep networks. Overall, deep networks achieve much better performance than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. However, the current deep networks used for cloud detection depend on massive pixel-level annotation labels, which require a great deal of manual annotation labor. To reduce the labor needed for annotating the pixel-level labels, this paper proposes a weakly supervised deep learning-based cloud detection (WDCD) method using block-level labels indicating only the presence or the absence of cloud in one RS image block. In the training phase, a new global convolutional pooling (GCP) operation is proposed to enhance the ability of the feature map to represent useful information (e.g., spatial variance). In the testing phase, the trained deep networks are modified to generate the cloud activation map (CAM) via the local pooling pruning (LPP) strategy, which prunes the local pooling layers of the deep networks that are trained in the training phase to improve the quality (e.g., spatial resolution) of CAM. One large RS image is cropped into multiple overlapping blocks by a sliding window, and then the CAM of each block is generated by the modified deep networks. Based on the correspondence between the image blocks and CAMs, multiple corresponding CAMs are collected to mosaic the CAM of the large image. By segmenting the CAM using a statistical threshold against a clear-sky surface, the pixel-level cloud mask of the testing image can be obtained. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed WDCD method, we collected a new global dataset, for which the training dataset contains over 200,000 RS image blocks with block-level labels from 622 large GaoFen-1 images from all over the world; the validation dataset contains 5 large GaoFen-1 images with pixel-level annotation labels, and the testing dataset contains 25 large GaoFen-1 and ZiYuan-3 images with pixel-level annotation labels. Even under the extremely weak supervision, our proposed WDCD method could achieve excellent cloud detection performance with an overall accuracy (OA) as high as 96.66%. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed WDCD method obviously outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The collected datasets have been made publicly available online (https://github.com/weichenrs/WDCD)."
lidR: An R package for analysis of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the ‘state-of-the-art’ and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline."
Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for forest stand species mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery and environmental data in the Polish Carpathians,"Information about forest stand species distribution is essential for biodiversity modelling, forest disturbances, fire hazard and drought monitoring, biomass and carbon estimation, detection of non-native and invasive species, as well as for planning forest management strategies. High temporal and spectral resolution remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 mission enables the derivation of accurate and timely maps of tree species in forests in a cost-efficient way. However, there is still a lack of studies regarding forest stand species mapping for large areas like the Polish Carpathian Mountains (approx. 20,000 km2). In this study, we aimed to develop a workflow to obtain forest stand species maps with machine learning algorithms applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data at regional scale. Using variable importance techniques - Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) - we assessed three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM; mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies), i.e. 114 variables in total. Following a variable importance assessment, we produced maps of eleven tree species with the use of three Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) on nine different variable subsets, i.e. in total 27 classifications. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers - the highest overall accuracy exceeded 85% for SVM classification of all variables (86.9%), and 64 variables (85.6%). Including elevation information improved the accuracies. From the best five classifications we created a final ensemble map (overall accuracy of 86.6%) and a precision map based on the Simpson Index, which indicates where the five models agree. This ensemble approach allowed us to determine that the lowest precision occurred in foothills and basins with lower forest cover, in the areas with lack of good quality imagery, and at the borders of stands with homogenous species composition. On the other hand, the highest precision occurred in regions with homogenous stands with high forest and canopy cover. The study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data in mapping forest stand species in large mountainous areas with high accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of the ensemble approach, which enables to assess the classification precision."
Spectral characteristics of sea snot reflectance observed from satellites: Implications for remote sensing of marine debris,"In 2021, coastal communities in the Sea of Marmara were impacted by large sea snot events. Based on data collected by several satellite sensors, we analyze and present the spectral reflectance characteristics of sea snots in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Sea snots often form elongated image slicks in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) or false-colour RGB (FRGB) images. Most reflectance spectra of sea snots show largely featureless spectral shapes, with continuous reflectance increases from the blue to the red, which then become flat toward the near infrared wavelengths. Some reflectance spectra show a local trough around 670 nm, indicating presence of chlorophyll a pigment, and thereby live algae. A 20-year time series of satellite data also reveals large-scale sea snot events in the Sea of Marmara before 2021. These results suggest that it might be possible to develop algorithms to search and map sea snots at a global scale, as sea snot events also occur in other regions. The results also indicate that remote differentiation of sea snots and marine debris using multi-band sensors may be difficult because of the spectral similarity between them."
Full-coverage mapping and spatiotemporal variations of ground-level ozone (O3) pollution from 2013 to 2020 across China,"Ozone (O3) is an important trace and greenhouse gas in the atmosphere yet, and it threatens the ecological environment and
human health at the ground level. Large-scale and long-term studies of O3 pollution in China are few due to highly limited
direct measurements whose accuracy and density vary considerably. To overcome these limitations, we employed the ensemble
learning method of the extremely randomized trees model by utilizing the spatiotemporal information of a large number of input
variables from ground-based observations, remote sensing, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulation products to estimate
ground-level O3. This method yields uniform, long-term and continuous spatiotemporal information of daily maximum eighthour average (MDA8) O3 over China (called ChinaHighO3) from 2013 to 2020 at a 10 km resolution without any missing values
(spatial coverage = 100%). Evaluation against observations indicates that our O3 estimations and predictions are reliable
with an average out-of-sample (out-of-station) coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.87 (0.80) and root-mean-square error
of 17.10 (21.10) μg/m3 [units here are at standard conditions (273K, 1013hPa)], and are also robust at varying spatial and
temporal scales in China. This high-quality and full-coverage O3 dataset allows us to investigate the exposure and trends in O3
pollution at both long- and short-term scales. Trends in O3 concentrations varied substantially but showed an average growth
rate of 2.49 μg/m3/yr (p < 0.001) from 2013 to 2020 in China. Most areas show an increasing trend since 2015, especially in
summer ozone over the North China Plain. Our dataset accurately captured a recent national and regional O3 pollution event
from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic
emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. This carefully vetted and smoothed dataset is
valuable for studies on air pollution and environmental health in China."
"Mapping of crop types and crop sequences with combined time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data for Germany","Monitoring agricultural systems becomes increasingly important in the context of global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and the rising demand for agricultural products. High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data.

Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and non-drought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78% and 80%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping."
"Biomass estimation from simulated GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR across environmental gradients in Sonoma County, California","Estimates of the magnitude and distribution of aboveground carbon in Earth's forests remain uncertain, yet knowledge of forest carbon content at a global scale is critical for forest management in support of climate mitigation. In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three NASA missions (GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR) over Sonoma county in California, USA. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. GEDI and ICESat-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while UAVSAR's L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for NISAR. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used GEDI's footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to ICESat-2. For UAVSAR, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25 m, 100 m transect, and 1 ha) yielding RMSEs of 57%, 75%, and 89% for GEDI, NISAR, and ICESat-2 respectively. RMSE values increased for GEDI's power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87%). We also test the application of GEDI's biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from ICESat-2, and find that ICESat-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date SAR-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and ALS data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion."
"ACIX-Aqua: A global assessment of atmospheric correction methods for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 over lakes, rivers, and coastal waters","Atmospheric correction over inland and coastal waters is one of the major remaining challenges in aquatic remote sensing, often hindering the quantitative retrieval of biogeochemical variables and analysis of their spatial and temporal variability within aquatic environments. The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA – ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances (
). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in 
 and 
 were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15–30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20–30% uncertainties in 
 yielded 25–70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems."
"A review of vegetation phenological metrics extraction using time-series, multispectral satellite data","Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes, and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phenology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness, and growing season length) often termed “land surface phenology,” as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phenological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data-processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phenology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multiscale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams, and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization."
Corn yield prediction and uncertainty analysis based on remotely sensed variables using a Bayesian neural network approach,"As the world's leading corn producer, the United States supplies more than 30% of the global corn production. Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010–2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R2~0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the interannual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation.

NASA's surface biology and geology designated observable: A perspective on surface imaging algorithms,"The 2017–2027 National Academies' Decadal Survey, Thriving on Our Changing Planet, recommended Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) as a “Designated Targeted Observable” (DO). The SBG DO is based on the need for capabilities to acquire global, high spatial resolution, visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR; 380–2500 nm; ~30 m pixel resolution) hyperspectral (imaging spectroscopy) and multispectral midwave and thermal infrared (MWIR: 3–5 μm; TIR: 8–12 μm; ~60 m pixel resolution) measurements with sub-monthly temporal revisits over terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal marine habitats. To address the various mission design needs, an SBG Algorithms Working Group of multidisciplinary researchers has been formed to review and evaluate the algorithms applicable to the SBG DO across a wide range of Earth science disciplines, including terrestrial and aquatic ecology, atmospheric science, geology, and hydrology. Here, we summarize current state-of-the-practice VSWIR and TIR algorithms that use airborne or orbital spectral imaging observations to address the SBG DO priorities identified by the Decadal Survey: (i) terrestrial vegetation physiology, functional traits, and health; (ii) inland and coastal aquatic ecosystems physiology, functional traits, and health; (iii) snow and ice accumulation, melting, and albedo; (iv) active surface composition (eruptions, landslides, evolving landscapes, hazard risks); (v) effects of changing land use on surface energy, water, momentum, and carbon fluxes; and (vi) managing agriculture, natural habitats, water use/quality, and urban development. We review existing algorithms in the following categories: snow/ice, aquatic environments, geology, and terrestrial vegetation, and summarize the community-state-of-practice in each category. This effort synthesizes the findings of more than 130 scientists.

SO–CNN based urban functional zone fine division with VHR remote sensing image,"Functional zone reflects city's spatial structures, and as a carrier of social and economic activities, it is of critical significance to urban management, resource allocation and planning. However, most researches on functional zone division are based on a large spatial scale such as blocks or other scales larger than it. Aiming at a subtle fine functional result, the concept of Super Object (SO) was especially explained, also a Super Object - Convolutional Neural Network (SO–CNN) based urban functional zone fine division method with very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing image was proposed. The original image was firstly segmented into different SOs which correspond to the basic functional zone units in geography. A random point generation algorithm was used to generate the voting points for functional zone category identification, and then a trained CNN model was employed to assign functional attributes to those voting points. Then a statistical method was involved to count the frequency of the classified voting points of different functional attributes in each basic functional zone units. By voting process, the functional attribute with the highest frequency was assigned to the basic functional zone unit, which corrected the misclassification results of CNN to some extent. This paper also explored the scale effect of the SO on the final functional zone classification result from two aspects, spatial scale of SO and the sampling window size of CNN model. Because of the natural differences between functional zone division and land cover classification, region based overall accuracy assessment method was used to evaluate functional zone division result. Compared with other methods, SO–CNN method can generate higher accuracy and subtle result, based on which larger spatial scale results can be available by scaling-up, so SO–CNN method plays a great significant role on small scale functional space structure research.

Remote sensing in urban planning: Contributions towards ecologically sound policies?,"Remote sensing has evolved to become a key tool for various fields of environmental analysis, thus actively informing policy across areas and domains. To evaluate the degree to which remote sensing is contributing to the science of ecologically-oriented urban planning, we carried out a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database, searching for articles integrating knowledge in urban planning, remote sensing and ecology. We reviewed 186 articles, analysing various issues in urban environments worldwide. Key findings include that the level of integration between the three disciplines is limited, with only 12% of the papers fully integrating ecology, remote sensing and planning while 24% of the studies use specific methods from one domain only. The vast majority of studies is oriented towards contributing to the knowledge base or monitoring the impacts of existing policies. Few studies are directly policy relevant by either contributing to direct issues in planning and making specific design suggestions or evaluations. The accessibility of the scientific findings remains limited, as the majority of journal articles are not open access and proprietary software and data are frequently used. To overcome these issues, we suggest three future avenues for science as well as three potential entry points for remote sensing into applied urban planning. By doing so, remote sensing data could become a vital tool actively contributing to policies, civil engagement and concrete planning measures by providing independent and cost effective environmental analyses."
Fifty years of Landsat science and impacts,"Since 1972, the Landsat program has been continually monitoring the Earth, to now provide 50 years of digital, multispectral, medium spatial resolution observations. Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth's surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program's 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat's remarkable 50-year legacy."
"Remote sensing in agriculture—accomplishments, limitations, and opportunities","Remote sensing (RS) technologies provide a diagnostic tool that can serve as an early warning system, allowing the agricultural community to intervene early on to counter potential problems before they spread widely and negatively impact crop productivity. With the recent advancements in sensor technologies, data management and data analytics, currently, several RS options are available to the agricultural community. However, the agricultural sector is yet to implement RS technologies fully due to knowledge gaps on their sufficiency, appropriateness and techno-economic feasibilities. This study reviewed the literature between 2000 to 2019 that focused on the application of RS technologies in production agriculture, ranging from field preparation, planting, and in-season applications to harvesting, with the objective of contributing to the scientific understanding on the potential for RS technologies to support decision-making within different production stages. We found an increasing trend in the use of RS technologies in agricultural production over the past 20 years, with a sharp increase in applications of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) after 2015. The largest number of scientific papers related to UASs originated from Europe (34%), followed by the United States (20%) and China (11%). Most of the prior RS studies have focused on soil moisture and in-season crop health monitoring, and less in areas such as soil compaction, subsurface drainage, and crop grain quality monitoring. In summary, the literature highlighted that RS technologies can be used to support site-specific management decisions at various stages of crop production, helping to optimize crop production while addressing environmental quality, profitability, and sustainability."
Annual maps of global artificial impervious area (GAIA) between 1985 and 2018,"Artificial impervious areas are predominant indicators of human settlements. Timely, accurate, and frequent information on artificial impervious areas is critical to understanding the process of urbanization and land use/cover change, as well as of their impacts on the environment and biodiversity. Despite their importance, there still lack annual maps of high-resolution Global Artificial Impervious Areas (GAIA) with longer than 30-year records, due to the high demand of high performance computation and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. In this paper, we mapped annual GAIA from 1985 to 2018 using the full archive of 30-m resolution Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine platform. With ancillary datasets, including the nighttime light data and the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data, we improved the performance of our previously developed algorithm in arid areas. We evaluated the GAIA data for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and the mean overall accuracy is higher than 90%. A cross-product comparison indicates the GAIA data are the only dataset spanning over 30 years. The temporal trend in GAIA agrees well with other datasets at the local, regional, and global scales. Our results indicate that the GAIA reached 797,076 km2 in 2018, which is 1.5 times more than that in 1990. China and the United States (US) rank among the top two in artificial impervious area, accounting for approximately 50% of the world's total in 2018. The artificial impervious area of China surpassed that of the US in 2015. By 2018, the remaining eight among the top ten countries are India, Russia, Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Canada. The GAIA dataset can be freely downloaded from http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn."
Scale in remote sensing and GIS,"The recent emergence and widespread use of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) has prompted new interest in scale as a key component of these and other geographic information technologies. Techniques for dealing explicitly with scale are now available in GIS, but, until now, very little literature was available to consider and solve specific issues of scale.
With a balanced mixture of concepts, practical examples, techniques, and theory, Scale in Remote Sensing and GIS is a guide for students and users of remote sensing and GIS who must deal with the issues raised by multiple temporal and spatial scales."
Crop nitrogen monitoring: Recent progress and principal developments in the context of imaging spectroscopy missions,"Nitrogen (N) is considered as one of the most important plant macronutrients and proper management of N therefore is a pre-requisite for modern agriculture. Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, Narea) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors."
Monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat time series,"Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-use change, but it is difficult to monitor with remote sensing because it is often spatially dispersed, easily confused with spectrally similar land-use classes such as grasslands and fallow fields, and because post-agricultural succession can take different forms in different biomes. Due to these difficulties, prior assessments of cropland abandonment have largely been limited in resolution, extent, or both. However, cropland abandonment has wide-reaching consequences for the environment, food production, and rural livelihoods, which is why new approaches to monitor long-term cropland abandonment in different biomes accurately are needed. Our goals were to 1) develop a new approach to map the extent and the timing of abandoned cropland using the entire Landsat time series, and 2) test this approach in 14 study regions across the globe that capture a wide range of environmental conditions as well as the three major causes of abandonment, i.e., social, economic, and environmental factors. Our approach was based on annual maps of active cropland and non-cropland areas using Landsat summary metrics for each year from 1987 to 2017. We streamlined perpixel classifications by generating multi-year training data that can be used for annual classification. Based on the annual classifications, we analyzed land-use trajectories of each pixel in order to distinguish abandoned cropland, stable cropland, non-cropland, and fallow fields. In most study regions, our new approach separated abandoned cropland accurately from stable cropland and other classes. The classification accuracy for abandonment was highest in regions with industrialized agriculture (area-adjusted F1 score for Mato Grosso in Brazil: 0.8; Volgograd in Russia: 0.6), and drylands (e.g., Shaanxi in China, Nebraska in the U.S.: 0.5) where fields were large or spectrally distinct from non-cropland. Abandonment of subsistence agriculture with small field sizes (e.g., Nepal: 0.1) or highly variable climate (e.g., Sardinia in Italy: 0.2) was not accurately mapped. Cropland abandonment occurred in all study regions but was especially prominent in developing countries and formerly socialist states. In summary, we present here an approach for monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat imagery, which can be applied across diverse biomes and may thereby improve the understanding of the drivers and consequences of this important land-use change process."
Reconstructing 1-km-resolution high-quality PM2. 5 data records from 2000 to 2018 in China: spatiotemporal variations and policy implications,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can significantly harm human health and increase the risk of death.
Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall
low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China
have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5

records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatial-
resolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)

Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5
concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can
capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e.,
cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R2 = 0.86–0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R2 =
0.80–0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM2.5) provides the
longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation
patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and
remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions
combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 μg/m3
/yr (p <

0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 μg/m3

/yr (p < 0.001) over the last six
years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze

River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter. The China-
HighPM2.5 dataset will enable more insightful analyses regarding the causes and attribution of pollution over

medium- or small-scale areas."
"Hyperspectral remote sensing in lithological mapping, mineral exploration, and environmental geology: an updated review","Hyperspectral imaging has been used in a variety of geological applications since its advent in the 1970s. In the last few decades, different techniques have been developed by geologists to analyze hyperspectral data in order to quantitatively extract geological information from the high-spectral-resolution remote sensing images. We attempt to review and update various steps of the techniques used in geological information extraction, such as lithological and mineralogical mapping, ore exploration, and environmental geology. The steps include atmospheric correction, dimensionality processing, endmember extraction, and image classification. It is identified that per-pixel and subpixel image classifiers can generate accurate alteration mineral maps. Producing geological maps of different surface materials including minerals and rocks is one of the most important geological applications. The hyperspectral images classification methods demonstrate the potential for being used as a main tool in the mining industry and environmental geology. To exemplify the potential, we also include a few case studies of different geological applications."
Monitoring tropical forest degradation using spectral unmixing and Landsat time series analysis,"Tropical forest loss currently contributes 5 to 15% of anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The large uncertainty in emissions estimates is a consequence of many factors, including differences in definitions of forests and degradation, as well as estimation methodologies. However, a primary factor driving uncertainty is an inability to properly account for forest degradation. While remote sensing offers the only practical way of monitoring forest disturbances over large areas, and despite recent improvements in data quality and quantity and processing techniques, remote sensing approaches are still limited in their ability to detect forest degradation. In this paper, a system is presented that uses time series of Landsat data and spectral mixture analysis to detect both degradation and deforestation in forested landscapes. The Landsat data are transformed into spectral endmember fractions and are used to calculate the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index (NDFI; Souza et al., 2005). The spectrally unmixed data are used for disturbance monitoring and land cover classification via time series analysis. To assess the performance of the system, maps of deforestation and degradation were used to stratify the study area for collection of sample data to which unbiased estimators were applied to produce accuracy and area estimates of degradation and deforestation from 1990 to 2013. The approach extends previous research in spectral mixture analysis for identifying forest degradation to the temporal domain. The method was applied using the Google Earth Engine and tested in the Brazilian State of Rondônia. Degradation and deforestation were mapped with 88.0% and 93.3% User's Accuracy, and 68.1% and 85.3% Producer's Accuracy. Area estimates of degradation and deforestation were produced with margins of error of 13.9% and 5.3%, respectively, over the 24 year time period. These results indicate that for Rondônia a decreasing trend in deforestation after 2004 corresponds to an increase in degradation during the same time period."
Terrestrial laser scanning in forest ecology: Expanding the horizon,"Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was introduced for basic forest measurements, such as tree height and diameter, in the early 2000s. Recent advances in sensor and algorithm development have allowed us to assess in situ 3D forest structure explicitly and revolutionised the way we monitor and quantify ecosystem structure and function. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary focus to explore current developments in TLS to measure and monitor forest structure. We argue that TLS data will play a critical role in understanding fundamental ecological questions about tree size and shape, allometric scaling, metabolic function and plasticity of form. Furthermore, these new developments enable new applications such as radiative transfer modelling with realistic virtual forests, monitoring of urban forests and larger scale ecosystem monitoring through long-range scanning. Finally, we discuss upscaling of TLS data through data fusion with unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne and spaceborne data, as well as the essential role of TLS in validation of spaceborne missions that monitor ecosystem structure."
"Mapping sugarcane plantation dynamics in Guangxi, China, by time series Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat images","Sugarcane is a major crop for sugar and ethanol production and its area has increased substantially in tropical and subtropical regions in recent decades. Updated and accurate sugarcane maps are critical for monitoring sugarcane area and production and assessing its impacts on the society, economy and the environment. To date, no sugarcane mapping tools are available to generate annual maps of sugarcane at the field scale over large regions. In this study, we developed a pixel- and phenology-based mapping tool to produce an annual map of sugarcane at 10-m spatial resolution by analyzing time-series Landsat-7/8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images (LC/S2/S1) during August 31, 2017 - July 1, 2019 in Guangxi province, China, which accounts for 65% of sugarcane production of China. First, we generated annual maps of croplands and other land cover types in 2018. Second, we delineated the cropping intensity (single, double and triple cropping in a year) for all cropland pixels in 2018. Third, we identified sugarcane fields in 2018 based on its phenological characteristics. The resultant 2018 sugarcane map has producer, user and overall accuracies of 88%, 96% and 96%, respectively. According to the annual sugarcane map in 2018, there was a total of 8940 km2 sugarcane in Guangxi, which was ~1% higher than the estimate from the Guangxi Agricultural Statistics Report. Finally, we identified green-up dates of those sugarcane fields in 2019, which could be used to support the sugarcane planting and management activities. Our study demonstrates the potential of the pixel- and phenology-based sugarcane mapping tool (both the algorithms and the LC/S2/S1 time series images) in identifying croplands, cropping intensity and sugarcane fields in the complex landscapes with diverse crop types, fragmented crop fields and frequent cloudy weather. The resultant annual maps from this study could be used to assist farms and sugarcane mills for sustainable sugarcane production and environment."
Automated detection of rock glaciers using deep learning and object-based image analysis,"Rock glaciers are an important component of the cryosphere and are one of the most visible manifestations of permafrost. While the significance of rock glacier contribution to streamflow remains uncertain, the contribution is likely to be important for certain parts of the world. High-resolution remote sensing data has permitted the creation of rock glacier inventories for large regions. However, due to the spectral similarity between rock glaciers and the surrounding material, the creation of such inventories is typically conducted based on manual interpretation, which is both time consuming and subjective. Here, we present a novel method that combines deep learning (convolutional neural networks or CNNs) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) into one workflow based on freely available Sentinel-2 optical imagery (10 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data, and a digital elevation model (DEM). CNNs identify recurring patterns and textures and produce a prediction raster, or heatmap where each pixel indicates the probability that it belongs to a certain class (i.e. rock glacier) or not. By using OBIA we can segment the datasets and classify objects based on their heatmap value as well as morphological and spatial characteristics. We analysed two distinct catchments, the La Laguna catchment in the Chilean semi-arid Andes and the Poiqu catchment in the central Himalaya. In total, our method mapped 108 of the 120 rock glaciers across both catchments with a mean overestimation of 28%. Individual rock glacier polygons howevercontained false positives that are texturally similar, such as debris-flows, avalanche deposits, or fluvial material causing the user's accuracy to be moderate (63.9–68.9%) even if the producer's accuracy was higher (75.0–75.4%). We repeated our method on very-high-resolution Pléiades satellite imagery and a corresponding DEM (at 2 m resolution) for a subset of the Poiqu catchment to ascertain what difference image resolution makes. We found that working at a higher spatial resolution has little influence on the producer's accuracy (an increase of 1.0%), however the rock glaciers delineated were mapped with a greater user's accuracy (increase by 9.1% to 72.0%). By running all the processing within an object-based environment it was possible to both generate the deep learning heatmap and perform post-processing through image segmentation and object reshaping. Given the difficulties in differentiating rock glaciers using image spectra, deep learning combined with OBIA offers a promising method for automating the process of mapping rock glaciers over regional scales and lead to a reduction in the workload required in creating inventories."
Changes of water clarity in large lakes and reservoirs across China observed from long-term MODIS,"Water clarity is a well-established first-order indicator of water quality and has been used globally by water regulators in their monitoring and management programs. Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (ZSD) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle α, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS ZSD model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical ZSD models, our FUI and α-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer ZSD of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the ZSD of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of “high west and low east” over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China's population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the ZSD of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their ZSD value during the past 18 years while only 8.5% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake ZSD were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake ZSD was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term."
Applications of remote sensing in precision agriculture: A review,"Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications."
Mapping the multi-decadal mangrove dynamics of the Australian coastline,"Mangroves globally provide a diverse array of ecosystem services but these are impacted upon by both natural and anthropogenic drivers of change. In Australia, mangroves are protected by law and hence the natural drivers predominate. To determine annual national level changes in mangroves between 1987 and 2016, their extent (by canopy cover type) and dynamics were quantified using dense time-series (nominally every 16 days cloud permitting) of 25 m spatial resolution Landsat sensor data available within Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The potential area that mangroves occupied over this period was established as the union of mangrove maps generated for 1996, 2007–2010 and 2015/16 through the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW). Within this area, the green vegetation fractional cover (GVpc) was retrieved from each available cloud-masked Landsat scene through linear spectral unmixing. The 10th percentile (GVpc10) was then determined for each calendar year by comparing these data in a time-series. The percentage Planimetric Canopy Cover (PCC%) for each Landsat pixel was then estimated using a relationship between GVpc10 and LiDAR-derived PCC% (<1 m resolution and based on acquisitions from all states supporting mangroves, excluding Victoria). The resulting annual maps of mangrove extent and cover for Australia are the first to be generated at a continental scale and on an annual basis. These indicated that the total area of mangrove forest (canopy cover >20%; resolvable at the Landsat resolution) varied from a minima of 10,715 ± 36 km2 (95% confidence interval) in 1992 to a maxima of 11,388 km2 ± 38 km2 (95% CI) in 2010, declining to 11,142 ± 57 km2 (95% CI) in 2017. In 2010 (maximum extent), the forests were classified as closed canopy (38.8%), open canopy (49.0%) and woodland mangrove (12.2%). The majority of change occurred along the northern Australian coastline and was concentrated in the major gulfs and sounds. The 30 national maps of annual mangrove extent represent a reference dataset, which is publicly available through the Terrestrial Environment Research Network (TERN) landscapes portal. Future efforts are focusing on the routine production of annual mangrove maps beyond 2019 as part of Australia's efforts to monitor the coastal environment."
WHU-Hi: UAV-borne hyperspectral with high spatial resolution (H2) benchmark datasets and classifier for precise crop identification based on deep convolutional …,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral systems can acquire hyperspectral imagery with a high spatial resolution (which we refer to here as H2 imagery). As a result of the low operating cost, high flexibility, and the ability to achieve real-time data acquisition, UAV-borne hyperspectral systems have become an important data source for remote sensing based agricultural monitoring. However, precise crop classification based on UAV-borne H2 imagery is a challenging task when faced with a number of different crop classes. The traditional hyperspectral classification methods, such as the spectral-based and object-oriented classification methods, have difficulty in classifying H2 imagery, faced with the problems of salt-and-pepper (SP) noise and scale selection. In this article, the deep convolutional neural network with a conditional random field classifier (CNNCRF) framework is proposed for precise crop classification with UAV-borne H2 imagery. In the proposed method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract and fuse in-depth spectral and local spatial features, and the conditional random field (CRF) model further incorporates the spatial-contextual information to improve the problem of holes and isolated regions in the classification map. Meanwhile, virtual sample augmentation based on the hyperspectral imaging mechanism is used to lessen the issue of the limited labeled samples. To validate the results, a new dataset—the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset—has been built for precise crop classification. The experimental results obtained using the WHU-Hi dataset confirm the accuracy and visualization performance of the proposed CNNCRF classification method, which outperforms the previous methods. In addition, the WHU-Hi dataset could serve as a benchmark dataset for hyperspectral image classification studies."
Continental-scale mapping and analysis of 3D building structure,"Urban land use is often characterized based on the presence of built-up land, while the land use intensity of different locations is ignored. This narrow focus is at least partially due to a lack of data on the vertical dimension of urban land. The potential of Earth observation data to fill this gap has already been shown, but this has not yet been applied at large spatial scales. This study aims to map urban 3D building structure, i.e. building footprint, height, and volume, for Europe, the US, and China using random forest models. Our models perform well, as indicated by R2 values of 0.90 for building footprint, 0.81 for building height, and 0.88 for building volume, for all three case regions combined. In our multidimensional input variables, we find that built-up density derived from the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) is the most important variable for estimating building footprint, while backscatter intensity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the most important variable for estimating building height. A combination of the two is essential to estimate building volume. Our analysis further highlights the heterogeneity of 3D building structure across space. Specifically, buildings in China tend to be taller on average (10.35 m) compared to Europe (7.37 m) and the US (6.69 m). At the same time, the building volume per capita in China is lowest, with 302.3 m3 per capita, while Europe and the US show estimates of 404.6 m3 and 565.4 m3, respectively. The results of this study (3D building structure data for Europe, the US, and China) are publicly available, and can be used for further analysis of urban environment, spatial planning, and land use projections."
"Fusing simulated GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data for regional aboveground biomass mapping","Accurate mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for better understanding the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion."
Seamless retrievals of chlorophyll-a from Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (OLCI) in inland and coastal waters: A machine-learning approach,"Consistent, cross-mission retrievals of near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in various aquatic ecosystems with broad ranges of trophic levels have long been a complex undertaking. Here, we introduce a machine-learning model, the Mixture Density Network (MDN), that largely outperforms existing algorithms when applied across different bio-optical regimes in inland and coastal waters. The model is trained and validated using a sizeable database of co-located Chla measurements (n = 2943) and in situ hyperspectral radiometric data resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. Our performance evaluations of the model, via two-thirds of the in situ dataset with Chla ranging from 0.2 to 1209 mg/m3 and a mean Chla of 21.7 mg/m3, suggest significant improvements in Chla retrievals. For both MSI and OLCI, the mean absolute logarithmic error (MAE) and logarithmic bias (Bias) across the entire range reduced by 40–60%, whereas the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) improved two-to-three times over those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using independent Chla matchups (n < 800) for Sentinel-2A/B and -3A, we show that the MDN model provides most accurate products from recorded images processed via three different atmospheric correction processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), POLYMER, and ACOLITE, though the model is found to be sensitive to uncertainties in remote-sensing reflectance products. This manuscript serves as a preliminary study on a machine-learning algorithm with potential utility in seamless construction of Chla data records in inland and coastal waters, i.e., harmonized, comparable products via a single algorithm for MSI and OLCI data processing. The model performance is anticipated to enhance by improving the global representativeness of the training data as well as simultaneous retrievals of multiple optically active components of the water column."
Mapping Australia's dynamic coastline at mean sea level using three decades of Landsat imagery,"Accurate, robust and consistent coastline mapping is critical for characterising and managing coastal change. Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of freely available data for studying dynamic coastlines through time and across large spatial extents. However, previous satellite-derived shoreline mapping approaches have been challenged by two key limitations: the medium spatial resolution of freely available satellite data, and the confounding influence of tides that can obscure longer term patterns of coastal change. In this study we present Digital Earth Australia Coastlines, a new continental dataset documenting three decades of coastal change across Australia. We combine sub-pixel waterline extraction with a new pixel-based tidal modelling method to seamlessly map almost 2 million km of tide-datum shorelines along the entire Australian coast from 1988 to 2019. Our tidally-constrained median composite approach maps the dominant annual position of the shoreline at 0 m Above Mean Sea Level each year, suppressing the short-term influence of tides and sub-annual shoreline variability. Using this robust mid-term shoreline proxy, long-term coastal change rates spanning the last three decades were accurately quantified and mapped at the continental scale. We find that 22% of Australia's non-rocky coastline has retreated or grown significantly since 1988, with 16% changing at greater than 0.5 m per year. Although trends of retreat and growth were closely balanced across the Australian continent, our results highlight significant regional variability and extreme local hotspots of coastal change. Our findings provide new insights into patterns and trends of coastal change across Australia, and highlight advantages and limitations of tide modelling and composite-based methods for extracting consistent shoreline data and long-term coastal trends from earth observation data at continental scale. Digital Earth Australia Coastlines is made available to the public as free and open interactive tools and code to support future coastal research and management across Australia, and any coastal region globally with access to free and open medium resolution satellite data."
Quantification of lake clarity in China using Landsat OLI imagery data,"The eutrophication of lake and reservoir (hereafter referred to as lakes) has attracted concerns from the public and government in China. Water clarity is a reliable indicator for quantifying eutrophic status because of its strong association with chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter, and nutrients. Traditionally, water clarity is measured using Secchi disk depth (SD). By linking the spectral signal from water surface with in situ measured SD, remote sensing provides a useful tool for SD estimation at a large scale in a repetitive manner. Remote sensing derived water clarity has been reported in many regions with specific models established for different satellite overpasses concurrent with in situ measured SD, but national water clarity remained unknown in China. In this study, 2152 samples were collected from 34 field campaigns in 2013–2018, of which 1792 samples were gathered within ± 7 days of Landsat OLI overpasses. We used Landsat 8 OLI bands 1–4 to develop regression models (n = 1016), and 782 samples to validate model performances. We further collected three additional in situ SD datasets to validate the best performance model, and eventually used it to map SD at a national scale with OLI images mainly acquired in 2016. Our results indicated that the entire dataset of SD has a strong association with Landsat reflectance, yielding low root mean square error between measured and estimated SD (RMSE = 63 cm) for lakes in China. The national water clarity was averaged to 176 cm in 2016 with large spatial variability (S.D: 216 cm) due to the marked variation between turbid waters in the east plain area and clean water across the Tibet Plateau. Lakes in the northeastern (75 cm) and eastern (84 cm) China had low clarity due to shallow water depth combined with high suspended matter and algal abundance. Lakes in the Yungui Plateau (91 cm), Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions (114 cm) exhibited intermediate clarity; while lakes in the Tibet Plateau (294 cm) displayed the highest clarity. This investigation demonstrated that Landsat imagery with Rayleigh scattering correction reflectance combined with in situ observation can provide quantitative information about the lake clarity with surface area >8 ha. Moreover, this method has the potential to retrieve SD with archived Landsat imagery to determine the temporal variation of SD at national or continental scale which can be used to support inland water management and decision-maker for improving water quality."
PROSPECT-PRO for estimating content of nitrogen-containing leaf proteins and other carbon-based constituents,"Models of radiative transfer (RT) are important tools for remote sensing of vegetation, allowing for forward simulations of remotely sensed data as well as inverse estimation of biophysical and biochemical traits from vegetation optical properties. Estimation of foliar protein content is the key to monitor the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, in particular to assess the photosynthetic capacity of plants and to improve nitrogen management in agriculture. However, until now physically based leaf RT models have not allowed for proper spectral decomposition and estimation of leaf dry matter as nitrogen-based proteins and other carbon-based constituents (CBC) from optical properties of fresh and dry foliage. Such an achievement is the key for subsequent upscaling to canopy level and for development of new Earth observation applications.

Therefore, we developed a new version of the PROSPECT model, named PROSPECT-PRO, which separates the nitrogen-based constituents (proteins) from CBC (including cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, starch and sugars). PROSPECT-PRO was calibrated and validated on subsets of the LOPEX dataset, accounting for both fresh and dry broadleaf and grass samples. We applied an iterative model inversion optimization algorithm and identified the optimal spectral ranges for retrieval of proteins and CBC. When combining leaf reflectance and transmittance within the selected optimal spectral domains, PROSPECT-PRO inversions revealed similarly accurate CBC estimates of fresh and dry leaf samples (respective validation R2 = 0.96 and 0.95, NRMSE = 9.6% and 13.4%), whereas a better performance was obtained for fresh than for dry leaves when estimating proteins (respective validation R2 = 0.79 and 0.57, NRMSE = 15.1% and 26.1%). The accurate estimation of leaf constituents for fresh samples is attributed to the optimal spectral feature selection procedure.

We further tested the ability of PROSPECT-PRO to estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) as the sum of proteins and CBC using independent datasets acquired for numerous plant species. Results showed that both PROSPECT-PRO and PROSPECT-D inversions were able to produce comparable LMA estimates across an independent dataset gathering 1685 leaf samples (validation R2 = 0.90 and NRMSE = 16.5% for PROSPECT-PRO, and R2 = 0.90 and NRMSE = 18.3% for PROSPECT-D). Findings also revealed that PROSPECT-PRO is capable of assessing the carbon-to‑nitrogen ratio based on the retrieved CBC-to-proteins ratio (R2 = 0.87 and NRMSE = 15.7% for fresh leaves, and R2 = 0.65 and NRMSE = 28.1% for dry leaves). The performance assessment of newly designed PROSPECT-PRO demonstrates a promising potential for its involvement in precision agriculture and ecological applications aiming at estimation of leaf carbon and nitrogen contents from observations of current and forthcoming airborne and satellite imaging spectroscopy sensors."
DeepCropMapping: A multi-temporal deep learning approach with improved spatial generalizability for dynamic corn and soybean mapping,"Accurate crop mapping provides important and timely information for decision support on the estimation of crop production at large scale. Most existing crop-specific cover products based on remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms cannot serve large agriculture production areas as a result of poor model transfer capabilities. Developing a generalizable crop classification model for spatial transfer across regions is greatly needed. A deep learning approach, named DeepCropMapping (DCM), has been developed based on long short-term memory structure with attention mechanisms through integrating multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing data for large-scale dynamic corn and soybean mapping. Full cross validation of classification experiments were conducted in six sites each covering 2,890,000 pixels at 30 m resolution in the U.S. corn belt from Year 2015 to 2018. Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were adopted as the input satellite observations and ground reference, respectively. Transformer, Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were built for comparison. The DCM model produced a mean kappa score of 85.8% in base sites and a mean average kappa score of 82.0% in transfer sites at the end of the growing season. It yielded a comparable performance to Transformer and better than RF and MLP at the local test. The DCM model significantly outperformed other three models with a 95% confidence interval in the spatial transfer analysis. The results demonstrated the capability of learning generalizable features by the DCM model from ARD time series. The computational complexity analysis suggested that the DCM model required a shorter training time than Transformer but longer than MLP and RF. The results of the in-season classification experiment indicated the DCM model captured critical information from key growth phases and achieved higher accuracy than other models after the beginning of July. By monitoring the classification confidence in each time step, the results showed that the increased length of seasonal remote sensing time series would reduce the classification uncertainty in all sites. This study provided a viable option toward large-scale dynamic crop mapping through the integration of deep learning and remote sensing time series."
Performance evaluation of GEDI and ICESat-2 laser altimeter data for terrain and canopy height retrievals,"With the advent of the next generation of space-based laser altimeters, ICESat-2 and GEDI, we are entering an exciting era of active remote sensing of forests that offers unprecedented opportunities for the observation of forest structure. Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes (>30°) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall (>20 m) and dense canopies (>90%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat-2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument."
Robust algorithm for estimating total suspended solids (TSS) in inland and nearshore coastal waters,"One of the challenging tasks in modern aquatic remote sensing is the retrieval of near-surface concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP) -based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (bbp) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from bbp via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m3], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to >100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in Rrs leads to <20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads."
Multispectral high resolution sensor fusion for smoothing and gap-filling in the cloud,"Remote sensing optical sensors onboard operational satellites cannot have high spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions simultaneously. In addition, clouds and aerosols can adversely affect the signal contaminating the land surface observations. We present a HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM) algorithm to combine multispectral images of different sensors to reduce noise and produce monthly gap free high resolution (30 m) observations over land. Our approach uses images from the Landsat (30 m spatial resolution and 16 day revisit cycle) and the MODIS missions, both from Terra and Aqua platforms (500 m spatial resolution and daily revisit cycle). We implement a bias-aware Kalman filter method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain fused images at the Landsat spatial-resolution. The added bias correction in the Kalman filter estimates accounts for the fact that both model and observation errors are temporally auto-correlated and may have a non-zero mean. This approach also enables reliable estimation of the uncertainty associated with the final reflectance estimates, allowing for error propagation analyses in higher level remote sensing products. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated products through comparison with other state-of-the-art methods confirm the validity of the approach, and open the door to operational applications at enhanced spatio-temporal resolutions at broad continental scales."
Global canopy height regression and uncertainty estimation from GEDI LIDAR waveforms with deep ensembles,"NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a key climate mission whose goal is to advance our understanding of the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. While GEDI is the first space-based LIDAR explicitly optimized to measure vertical forest structure predictive of aboveground biomass, the accurate interpretation of this vast amount of waveform data across the broad range of observational and environmental conditions is challenging. Here, we present a novel supervised machine learning approach to interpret GEDI waveforms and regress canopy top height globally. We propose a probabilistic deep learning approach based on an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to avoid the explicit modelling of unknown effects, such as atmospheric noise. The model learns to extract robust features that generalize to unseen geographical regions and, in addition, yields reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Ultimately, the global canopy top height estimates produced by our model have an expected RMSE of 2.7 m with low bias."
Explaining the unsuitability of the kappa coefficient in the assessment and comparison of the accuracy of thematic maps obtained by image classification,"The kappa coefficient is not an index of accuracy, indeed it is not an index of overall agreement but
11 one of agreement beyond chance. Chance agreement is, however, irrelevant in an accuracy assessment
12 and is anyway inappropriately modelled in the calculation of a kappa coefficient for typical remote
13 sensing applications. The magnitude of a kappa coefficient is also difficult to interpret. Values that
14 span the full range of widely used interpretation scales, indicating a level of agreement that equates to
15 that estimated to arise from chance alone all the way through to almost perfect agreement, can be
16 obtained from classifications that satisfy demanding accuracy targets (e.g. for a classification with
17 overall accuracy of 95% the range of possible values of the kappa coefficient is -0.026 to 0.900).
18 Comparisons of kappa coefficients are particularly challenging if the classes vary in their abundance
19 (i.e. prevalence) as the magnitude of a kappa coefficient reflects not only agreement in labelling but
20 also properties of the populations under study. It is shown that all of the arguments put forward for the
21 use of the kappa coefficient in accuracy assessment are flawed and/or irrelevant as they apply equally
22 to other, sometimes easier to calculate, measures of accuracy. Calls for the kappa coefficient to be
23 abandoned from accuracy assessments should finally be heeded and researchers are encouraged to
24 provide a set of simple measures and associated outputs such as estimates of per-class accuracy and
25 the confusion matrix when assessing and comparing classification accuracy."
The PRISMA imaging spectroscopy mission: overview and first performance analysis,"The PRISMA satellite mission launched on March 22nd, 2019 is one of the latest spaceborne imaging spectroscopy mission for Earth Observation. The PRISMA satellite comprises a high-spectral resolution VNIR-SWIR imaging spectrometer and a panchromatic camera. In summer 2019, first operations during the commissioning phase were mainly devoted to acquisitions in specific areas for evaluating instrument functioning, in-flight performance, and mission data product accuracy. A field and airborne campaign was carried out over an agriculture area in Italy to collect in-situ multi-source spectroscopy measurements at different scales simultaneously with PRISMA. The spectral, radiometric and spatial performance of PRISMA Level 1 Top-Of-Atmosphere radiance (LTOA) product were analyzed. The in-situ surface reflectance measurements over different landcovers were propagated to LTOA using MODTRAN5 radiative transfer simulations and compared with satellite observations. Overall, this work offers a first quantitative evaluation about the PRISMA mission performance and imaging spectroscopy LTOA data product consistency. Our results show that the spectral smile is less than 5 nm, the average spectral resolution is 13 nm and 11 nm (VNIR and SWIR respectively) and it varies ±2 nm across track. The radiometric comparison between PRISMA and field/airborne spectroscopy shows a difference lower than 5% for NIR and SWIR, whereas it is included in the 2–7% range in the VIS. The estimated instrument signal to noise ratio (SNR) is ≈400–500 in the NIR and part of the SWIR (<1300 nm), lower SNR values were found at shorter (<700 nm) and longer wavelengths (>1600 nm). The VNIR-to-SWIR spatial co-registration error is below 8 m and the spatial resolution is 37.11 m and 38.38 m for VNIR and SWIR respectively. The results are in-line with the expectations and mission requirements and indicate that acquired images are suitable for further scientific applications. However, this first assessment is based on data from a rural area and this cannot be fully exhaustive. Further studies are needed to confirm the performance for other land cover types like snow, inland and coastal waters, deserts or urban areas."
"Lessons learned implementing an operational continuous United States national land change monitoring capability: The Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and …","Growing demands for temporally specific information on land surface change are fueling a new generation of maps and statistics that can contribute to understanding geographic and temporal patterns of change across large regions, provide input into a wide range of environmental modeling studies, clarify the drivers of change, and provide more timely information for land managers. To meet these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey has implemented a capability to monitor land surface change called the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative. This paper describes the methodological foundations and lessons learned during development and testing of the LCMAP approach. Testing and evaluation of a suite of 10 annual land cover and land surface change data sets over six diverse study areas across the United States revealed good agreement with other published maps (overall agreement ranged from 73% to 87%) as well as several challenges that needed to be addressed to meet the goals of robust, repeatable, and geographically consistent monitoring results from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. First, the high spatial and temporal variability of observational frequency led to differences in the number of changes identified, so CCDC was modified such that change detection is dependent on observational frequency. Second, the CCDC classification methodology was modified to improve its ability to characterize gradual land surface changes. Third, modifications were made to the classification element of CCDC to improve the representativeness of training data, which necessitated replacing the random forest algorithm with a boosted decision tree. Following these modifications, assessment of prototype Version 1 LCMAP results showed improvements in overall agreement (ranging from 85% to 90%)."
Hotspots of snow cover changes in global mountain regions over 2000–2018,"Quantification of snow cover changes and related phenology in global mountain areas has not been consistently addressed, despite the well-known importance of the snow in this environment. By using MODIS products from 2000 to 2018, this study reveals that around 78% of the global mountain areas are undergoing a snow decline characterized by snow cover duration decrease up to 43 days, and a snow cover area decrease up to 13%. Few areas show positive changes with snow cover duration increase up to 32 days, and snow cover area increase up to 11%, mainly during wintertime in Northern Hemisphere. Significant snow cover duration changes are related in 58% of the areas to both delayed snow onset, and earlier melt; moreover, the rate of earlier snowmelt is greater than the rate of later snow onset in the analyzed time period. Snow cover, and phenology changes are highly variable at mid-elevations, while from 4000 m upward only negative changes are detected. Air temperature is the main driver for snow onset and melt, while a combined effect of air temperature and precipitation dominates the winter season. These changes have multiple implications on water resources, ecosystem services, tourism, and energy production. The results are provided with the caveats that the short time period of the analysis (2000–2018) limit the attributions of long-term trends, and snow cover estimates are affected by uncertainties, which may be stronger in complex terrain."
Tree species classification from airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data using 3D convolutional neural networks,"During the last two decades, forest monitoring and inventory systems have moved from field surveys to remote sensing-based methods. These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data.

Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km2 study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification.

Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images. The improved tree species classification demonstrated by our study can benefit both sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation."
"SMOS-IC data record of soil moisture and L-VOD: Historical development, applications and perspectives","Passive microwave remote sensing observations at L-band provide key and global information on surface soil moisture and vegetation water content, which are related to the Earth water and carbon cycles. Only two space-borne L-band sensors are currently operating: SMOS, launched end of 2009 and thus providing now a 10-year global data set and SMAP, launched beginning of 2015. This study provides a state-of-the-art scientific overview of the SMOS-IC retrieval data set based on the SMOS L-band observations. This SMOS product aims at improved performance and independence of auxiliary data, key features for robust applications. The SMOS-IC product includes both a soil moisture (SM) and a L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) data set which are currently at the basis of several studies evaluating the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on aboveground carbon stocks. Since the release of the first version, the algorithm has been significantly changed in support to key applications, but no document is available to report these changes. This paper fills this gap by analyzing key science questions related to the product development, reviewing application results and presenting an extensive description of the last version of the product (version 2) considering changes in comparison to the previous version (V105). For the future it is planned to merge the SMOS and SMAP L-VOD data sets to ensure L-VOD data continuity in the event of failure of one of the space-borne SMOS or SMAP sensors."
Modelling lidar-derived estimates of forest attributes over space and time: A review of approaches and future trends,"Light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms have revolutionized measurement and mapping of forest attributes. Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be – due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates – insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 (mean = 0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE% from 12 to 34%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean = 0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean = 0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44 Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change."
Monitoring changes in global soil organic carbon stocks from space,"Soils are under threat globally, with declining soil productivity and soil health in many places. As a key
indicator of soil functioning, soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for ensuring food, soil, water and energy
security, together with biodiversity protection. While there is a global effort to map SOC stock and status,
SOC is a dynamic soil property and can change rapidly as a function of land management and land use.
Here, we introduce a semi-mechanistic model to monitor SOC stocks at a global scale, underpinned by one
of the largest worldwide soil database to date. Our model generates a SOC stock baseline for the year
2001, which is then propagated through time by keeping track of annual landcover changes obtained from
remote sensing products with loss and gain dynamics dependent on temperature and precipitation, which
finally define the magnitude, rate and direction of the SOC changes. We estimated a global SOC stock
in the top 30 cm of around 793 Pg with annual losses due to landcover change of 1.9 Pg SOC yr−1
from
2001 to 2020, 20% larger than the annual production-based emissions of the United States in 2018. The
biggest losses were found in the tropic and sub-tropical regions, accounting for almost 50% of the total
global loss. This is a considerable contribution to greenhouse gas emissions but it also has a direct impact
on agricultural production with more than 16 million hectares yr−1
falling below critical SOC limits. The
proposed modelling framework is flexible, allowing it to be updated as more remote sensing and soil data
becomes available, offering a first-of-its-kind global spatio-temporal SOC stock assessment and monitoring
system."
A roadmap for high-resolution satellite soil moisture applications–confronting product characteristics with user requirements,"Soil moisture observations are of broad scientific interest and practical value for a wide range of applications. The scientific community has made significant progress in estimating soil moisture from satellite-based Earth observation data, particularly in operationalizing coarse-resolution (25-50 km) soil moisture products. This review summarizes existing applications of satellite-derived soil moisture products and identifies gaps between the characteristics of currently available soil moisture products and the application requirements from various disciplines. We discuss the efforts devoted to the generation of high-resolution soil moisture products from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data such as Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter observations and/or through downscaling of existing coarse-resolution microwave soil moisture products. Open issues and future opportunities of satellite-derived soil moisture are discussed, providing guidance for further development of operational soil moisture products and bridging the gap between the soil moisture user and supplier communities."

A machine learning approach to estimate chlorophyll-a from Landsat-8 measurements in inland lakes,"Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) provides an opportunity to map chlorophyll-a (Chla) in lake waters at
spatial scales not feasible with ocean color missions. Although state-of-the-art algorithms to estimate Chla in
lakes from satellite-borne sensors have improved, there are no robust and reliable algorithms to generate Chla
time series from OLI imageries in turbid lakes due to the absence of a red-edge band and issues with atmospheric
correction. Here, a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (BST) was employed to
develop an algorithm for Chla estimation from OLI in turbid lakes. This model was developed and validated by
linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to near-synchronous in situ Chla data available from eight lakes in eastern
China (N = 225) and three coastal and inland waters in SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System
(N = 97). The BST model performed well on a subset of data (N = 102, R2 = 0.79, root mean squared
difference = 7.1 μg L−1, mean absolute percentage error = 24%, mean absolute error = 1.4, Bias = 0.9), and
had better Chla retrievals than several band-ratio algorithms and a random forest approach. The performance of

BST model was judged as appropriate only for the range of conditions in the training data. Given these lim-
itations, spatial and temporal variations of Chla in hundreds of lakes larger than 1 km2 in eastern China for the

period of 2013–2018 were mapped using the BST model. OLI-derived Chla indicated that small lakes (<50 km2
)
had greater Chla than the larger lakes. This research suggests that machine-learning models provide practical
approaches to estimate Chla in turbid lakes via broadband instruments like OLI and that extending to other
regions requires training with a representative dataset."
"Mapping understory invasive plant species with field and remotely sensed data in Chitwan, Nepal","Monitoring invasive species distribution and prevalence is important, but direct field-based assessment is often impractical. In this paper, we introduce and validate a cost-effective method for mapping understory invasive plant species. We utilized Landsat imagery, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and a maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling framework to map the spatial extent of Mikania micrantha in Chitwan National Park, Nepal and community forests within its buffer zone. We developed a spectral library from reference and image sources and applied multiple endmember SMA (MESMA) to selected Landsat imagery. Incorporating the resultant green vegetation and shade fractions into Maxent, we mapped the distribution of understory M. micrantha in the study area, with training and testing Area under Curve (AUC) values around 0.80, and kappa around 0.55. In vegetated places, especially mature forests, an increase in green vegetation fraction and decrease in shade fraction was associated with higher likelihood of M. micrantha presence. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a model input further improved map accuracy (AUC around 0.95; kappa around 0.80). Elevation, a surrogate for distance to water in this case, proved to be the determining factor of M. micrantha's distribution in the study area. The combination of MESMA and Maxent can provide significant opportunities for understanding understory vegetation distribution, and contribute to ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, and provision of sustainable ecosystem services in protected areas.

Aboveground biomass density models for NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar mission,"NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne full waveform lidar data with a primary science goal of producing accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD). This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI’s footprint-level (~25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI’s waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available."
Continental-scale land surface phenology from harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery,"Dense time series of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery are creating exciting new opportunities to monitor, map, and characterize temporal dynamics in land surface properties with unprecedented spatial detail and quality. By combining imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the MultiSpectral Instrument on-board Sentinel-2A and -2B, the remote sensing community now has access to moderate (10–30 m) spatial resolution imagery with repeat periods of ~3 days in the mid-latitudes. At the same time, the large combined data volume from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 introduce substantial new challenges for users. Land surface phenology (LSP) algorithms, which estimate the timing of phenophase transitions and quantify the nature and magnitude of seasonality in remotely sensed land surface conditions, provide an intuitive way to reduce data volumes and redundancy, while also furnishing data sets that are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring ecosystem response to climate variability and extreme events, ecosystem modelling, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping, among others. To support the need for operational LSP data sets, here we describe a continental-scale land surface phenology algorithm and data product based on harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery. The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution. We present results from assessment efforts evaluating LSP retrievals, and provide examples illustrating the character and quality of information related to land cover and terrestrial ecosystem properties provided by the continental LSP dataset that we have developed. The algorithm is highly successful in ecosystems with strong seasonal variation in leaf area (e.g., deciduous forests). Conversely, results in evergreen systems are less interpretable and conclusive."
How to quantify the cooling effect of urban parks? Linking maximum and accumulation perspectives,"Urban parks can significantly alleviate the urban heat island, an ecological issue caused by urbanization. Clarifying urban park cooling effect can improve climate change adaptability and urban sustainability. However, park cooling effects were mainly explored in maximum perspective in previous studies, without considering the cumulative impact resulting from spatial continuity. Therefore, focusing on 24 urban parks in the main city zone of Shenzhen, China, such cumulative indexes as park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, were proposed in this study and integrated with maximum indexes of park cooling area and park cooling efficiency, so as to explore park cooling effects comprehensively. The results showed that the park areas and cold spot areas of land surface temperature overlapped spatially by 64.40%. The partial correlation analysis showed that, park perimeter, area and shape index were significantly and positively correlated with park cooling area, with significantly negative correlation for park cooling efficiency. The vegetation index was significantly and positively correlated with park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, and the impact of water body area ratio to all the four park cooling indexes was not significant. Then cooling effects of 24 urban parks were classified into four cooling capacity bundles, which showed that parks designed to serve different social functions behaved different cooling effects. The cooling effect of comprehensive parks was more efficient, with the same low value of all four cooling indexes for theme parks, high cooling intensity and cooling gradient for small ecological parks, and the highest cooling area for large ecological parks. This study proposed a comprehensive approach to measuring park cooling effects with both maximum and accumulation perspectives, which can guide urban park planning and design to maximize the ecological benefits."
Night and day: The influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on remotely sensed land surface temperature,"The characteristics of urban land surfaces contribute to the urban heat island, and, in turn, can exacerbate the severity of heat wave impacts. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question “What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?” To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation."
"Living up to the hype of hyperspectral aquatic remote sensing: science, resources and outlook","Intensifying pressure on global aquatic resources and services due to population growth and climate change is inspiring new surveying technologies to provide science-based information in support of management and policy strategies. One area of rapid development is hyperspectral remote sensing: imaging across the full spectrum of visible and infrared light. Hyperspectral imagery contains more environmentally meaningful information than panchromatic or multispectral imagery and is poised to provide new applications relevant to society, including assessments of aquatic biodiversity, habitats, water quality, and natural and anthropogenic hazards. To aid in these advances, we provide resources relevant to hyperspectral remote sensing in terms of providing the latest reviews, databases, and software available for practitioners in the field. We highlight recent advances in sensor design, modes of deployment, and image analysis techniques that are becoming more widely available to environmental researchers and resource managers alike. Systems recently deployed on space- and airborne platforms are presented, as well as future missions and advances in unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) and autonomous in-water survey methods. These systems will greatly enhance the ability to collect interdisciplinary observations on-demand and in previously inaccessible environments. Looking forward, advances in sensor miniaturization are discussed alongside the incorporation of citizen science, moving toward open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data. Advances in machine learning and cloud computing allow for exploitation of the full electromagnetic spectrum, and better bridging across the larger scientific community that also includes biogeochemical modelers and climate scientists. These advances will place sophisticated remote sensing capabilities into the hands of individual users and provide on-demand imagery tailored to research and management requirements, as well as provide critical input to marine and climate forecasting systems. The next decade of hyperspectral aquatic remote sensing is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we assess and monitor aquatic environments and detect changes relevant to global communities."
Generation of MODIS-like land surface temperatures under all-weather conditions based on a data fusion approach,"Land surface temperature (LST) is among the most important variables in monitoring land surface processes. LST is often retrieved from thermal infrared remote sensing data, which have a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions and are spatially incomplete due to cloud contamination. Land surface model (LSM) output can reflect LST under all-weather conditions, but the spatial resolution is relatively coarse. In this study, a two-step LST data fusion framework was proposed for generating MODIS-like LST (at the satellite overpass time for each day) at a 1 km spatial resolution under all-weather conditions. First, MODIS LST on clear days (i.e., all MODIS LST pixels are cloud-free) for a given study region (e.g., 80 km × 80 km) and China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST at a spatial resolution of ~7 km × 7 km were fused using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). Second, systematic biases of the fused LST estimates were corrected by MODIS LST for clear pixels on cloudy days. Results indicate that the fused LST after bias correction (fused LSTcorr) under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with in situ LST measurements made at three sites with different land cover types in the north of China, in terms of mean absolute errors of 2.20–3.08 K, root mean square errors of 2.77–3.96 K, and coefficients of determination of 0.93–0.95. The accuracy of these results is comparable to that of the MODIS LST retrievals at all testing sites. In addition, the fused LSTcorr can well reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in LST under all-weather conditions, and there is no significant difference in the accuracy of the fused LSTcorr between the clear and cloudy pixels on cloudy days. The developed approach maximizes the potential of quality MODIS LST retrievals and LSM LST output, and generates LST under all-weather conditions without using ancillary remote sensing and in situ data. The generated MODIS-like LST data under all-weather conditions are valuable in soil moisture downscaling and evapotranspiration estimation for better water resources management."
Sentinel-3 OLCI observations of water clarity in large lakes in eastern China: Implications for SDG 6.3. 2 evaluation,"The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.3.2 of the United Nations (UN) focuses on ambient water quality,

while water clarity simplistically and visually reflect water quality and can potentially support SDG 6.3.2 re-
porting. In this study, based on extensive field data and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI)

imagery, a random forest regression (RFR) Secchi depth (Zsd) model suitable for turbid and eutrophic waters was
established. With this model, the Zsd of 86 large (> 30 km2

) lakes in Eastern China was obtained from May 2016
to April 2018. Additionally, the potential for applying OLCI-derived Zsd data in the SDG 6.3.2 evaluation was
assessed. Of six common atmospheric correction (AC) processors (i.e., BAC, C2RCC, POLYMER, BP, MUMM, and
6SV), 6SV often exhibited the best performance except for at 754 nm (root mean square error
(RMSE) ≤ 0.0094 sr−1, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ≤ 36.27%, and mean normalized bias
(MNB) ≤ 15.89%). The RFR model had higher accuracy (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.13 m, MAPE = 33.43%, and
MNB = 14.55%) and was more suitable for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across Eastern China than the
other available Zsd algorithms. The average OLCI-derived Zsd of the lakes in Eastern China was 0.44 ± 0.13 m,
suggesting that these lakes are extremely turbid. The average Zsd of lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) zone
(0.45 ± 0.12 m) was higher than that of the lakes in the Northeastern Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) zone
(0.40 ± 0.17 m). The majority of lakes showed higher Zsd values in summer (rainy season) than in fall and
winter (dry season). A simple SDG 6.3.2 evaluation scheme was developed based on the Zsd product, and only

54.65% of the lakes (N = 47) reached the “good” level during the monitoring period as a result of the eu-
trophication of the lakes in Eastern China. This study provides water clarity information for large lakes in Eastern

China and facilitates the understanding of ambient water quality under the 2030 UN SDG framework as well as
data and technical support for future SDG 6.3.2 evaluations."
Generating surface soil moisture at 30 m spatial resolution using both data fusion and machine learning toward better water resources management at the field scale,"Soil moisture has a considerable impact on the hydrological cycle, runoff generation, drought development, and water resources management. Soil moisture products provided by passive microwave remote sensing possess coarse spatial resolutions ranging from 25 to 50 km, unable to reflect large spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture caused by complex interactions among meteorological forcing, land cover, and topography. Meanwhile, active microwave remote sensing can provide higher spatial resolution than passive sensors that may reach 1 km but with lower temporal resolution of 6–12 days (e.g., Sentinel-1). Better water resources management, particularly for the agricultural sector, requires spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimates at the field scale (e.g., 30 m × 30 m) to reflect its high spatiotemporal variability across heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both data fusion and random forest models along with a range of remote sensing, reanalysis, and in situ data were jointly used to generate spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m × 30 m. First, both daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo at 30 m × 30 m were generated by fusing reflectance products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. Second, China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625° × 0.0625°) land surface temperature (LST) was fused with both MODIS LST and Landsat LST to generate spatially complete LST maps (at 11 a.m. local solar time for each day) at 30 m × 30 m. Last, random forest models were developed to generate spatiotemporally continuous SSM of 30 m × 30 m using the fused variables at fine spatial resolution (e.g., NDVI, surface albedo, and LST), SSM background fields, and ancillary variables such as precipitation and soil texture as the model inputs. Compared with original SSM of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Version 4.4 SSM, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 SSM, and CLDAS SSM, the downscaled SSM using these products as background fields was improved significantly in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. Moreover, the integration of multiple SSM background fields improved the performance of the downscaled SSM significantly in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and accuracy compared with that using a single SSM background field. Overall, the downscaled SMAP_L4 + CLDAS SSM showed the best performance at four sites (i.e., Weishan, Huailai, Hujiatan, and Paihuai) out of seven sites on the North China Plain with R, bias, MAE, RMSE, and ubRMSE ranging from 0.70–0.84, −0.034–0.012 cm3/cm3, 0.025–0.044 cm3/cm3, 0.031–0.050 cm3/cm3, and 0.022–0.042 cm3/cm3, respectively. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of data fusion, random forest models, and in situ data in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SSM estimates at 30 m × 30 m, which should be valuable for water resources management at the field scale."
National-scale mapping of building height using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series,"Urban areas and their vertical characteristics have a manifold and far-reaching impact on our environment. However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale. It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software, which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis of structural features or mapping society's resource usage."
World Settlement Footprint 3D-A first three-dimensional survey of the global building stock,"Settlements, and in particular cities, are at the center of key future challenges related to global change and sustainable development. Widely used indicators to assess the efficiency and sustainability of settlement development are the compactness and density of the built-up area. However, at global scale, a temporally consistent and spatially detailed survey of the distribution and concentration of the building stock – meaning the total area and volume of buildings within a defined spatial unit or settlement, commonly referred to as building density – does not yet exist. To fill this data and knowledge gap, an approach was developed to map key characteristics of the world's building stock in a so far unprecedented level of spatial detail for every single settlement on our planet. The resulting World Settlement Footprint 3D dataset quantifies the fraction, total area, average height, and total volume of buildings for a measuring grid with 90 m cell size. The World Settlement Footprint 3D is generated using a modified version of the World Settlement Footprint human settlements mask derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 10 m spatial resolution, in combination with 12 m digital elevation data and radar imagery collected by the TanDEM-X mission. The underlying, automated processing framework includes three basic workflows: one estimating the mean building height based on an analysis of height differences along potential building edges, a second module determining the building fraction and total building area within each 90 m cell, and a third part combining the height information and building area in order to determine the average height and total built-up volume at 90 m gridding. Optionally, a simple 3D building model (level of detail 1) can be generated for regions where data on the building footprints is available. A comprehensive validation campaign based on 3D building models obtained for 19 regions (~86,000 km2) and street-view samples indicating the number of floors for >130,000 individual buildings in 15 additional cities documents that the novel World Settlement Footprint 3D data provides valuable and, for the first time, globally consistent information on key characteristics of the building stock in both, large urban agglomerations as well as small-scale rural settlements. Thus, the new dataset represents a promising baseline dataset for a wide range of previously impossible environmental, socioeconomic, and climatological studies worldwide."
Towards national-scale characterization of grassland use intensity from integrated Sentinel-2 and Landsat time series,"The increased availability of systematically acquired high spatial and temporal resolution optical imagery improves the characterization of dynamic land surface processes such as agriculture. The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates. The mapped mowing patterns depict typical management regimes across Germany. Overall, our results exemplify the value of multi-sensor time series applications for characterizing land use intensity across large areas.

Monitoring temperate forest degradation on Google Earth Engine using Landsat time series analysis,"Current estimates of forest degradation are associated with large uncertainties. However, recent advancements in the availability of remote sensing data (e.g., the free data policies of the Landsat and Sentinel Programs) and cloud computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)) provide new opportunities for monitoring forest degradation. Several recent studies focus on monitoring forest degradation in the tropics, particularly the Amazon, but there are less studies of temperate forest degradation. Compared to the Amazon, temperate forests have more seasonality, which complicates satellite-based monitoring. Here, we present an approach, Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis (CCDC-SMA), that combines time series analysis and spectral mixture analysis running on GEE for monitoring abrupt and gradual forest degradation in temperate regions. We used this approach to monitor forest degradation and deforestation from 1987 to 2019 in the country of Georgia. Reference conditions were observed at sample locations selected under stratified random sampling for area estimation and accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of our map was 91%. The user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of the forest degradation class were 69% and 83%, respectively. The sampling-based area estimate with 95% confidence intervals of forest degradation was 3541 ± 556 km2 (11% of the forest area in 1987), which was significantly larger than the area estimate of deforestation, 158 ± 98 km2. Our approach successfully mapped forest degradation and estimated the area of forest degradation in Georgia with small uncertainty, which earlier studies failed to estimate.

"Rapid, robust, and automated mapping of tidal flats in China using time series Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine","Tidal flats are threatened by tidal reclamation and climatic changes around the world. Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2–5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.

Towards interpreting multi-temporal deep learning models in crop mapping,"Multi-temporal deep learning approaches have exhibited excellent classification performance in large-scale crop

mapping. These approaches efficiently and automatically transform remote sensing time series into high-
dimensional feature representations to identify crop types. The lack of interpretation, however, is regarded as

a major drawback of these high-performance approaches. Interpreting deep learning approaches in multi-
temporal crop mapping is critical for verifying their reliability. This study aims to quantify the impact of

multi-temporal information in input time series on classification performance and develop a multi-perspective

interpretation pipeline for deep learning models. The pipeline involves three interpretation approaches: evalu-
ating input feature importance, analyzing hidden features, and monitoring temporal changes in model's soft

output. An experiment is conducted to classify corn and soybean in the U.S corn belt in 2018. The study area
consists of three sites each encompassing millions of pixel-level samples at 30 m resolution. The Landsat Analysis
Ready Data are used as the input remote sensing time series and Cropland Data Layer is used as the ground

reference. Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (AtLSTM) and Transformer models are built as multi-
temporal deep learning models, and compared to Random Forest (RF). Complete time series input in the cor-
rect order achieves a higher overall accuracy of 97.8% than using single-window or out-of-order inputs, indi-
cating multi-temporal information facilitates crop classification. An assessment of the input feature importance

demonstrates that the AtLSTM, Transformer, and RF models all consider the period from weeks 11 to 20 (early-
July to late-August) as a key growth period and the shortwave infrared band as the critical band for corn and

soybean discrimination. Hidden feature analysis suggests that the AtLSTM model accumulates the useful infor-
mation over the growth period, while the Transformer model extracts the temporal dependencies that contribute

important information to high-level feature learning. The learned features contain more effective and refined
information than the raw input features and thus are better suited for crop classification. The soft output analysis
in the in-season classification scenario demonstrates that increased length of input time series improves the
model's confidence in the classification results. The further comparison of input feature importance in different
sites and years demonstrates the applicability of the interpretation approach at larger spatiotemporal extents
with heterogeneous landscapes and interannual variability. This study provides a multi-perspective evaluation to
identify key features in multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing data, and yields a practical approach to
integrate agronomy knowledge in deep learning-based crop mapping."
Monthly estimation of the surface water extent in France at a 10-m resolution using Sentinel-2 data,"The first national product of Surface Water Dynamics in France (SWDF) is generated on a monthly temporal scale and 10-m spatial scale using an automatic rule-based superpixel (RBSP) approach. The current surface water dynamic products from high resolution (HR) multispectral satellite imagery are typically analyzed to determine the annual trend and related seasonal variability. Annual and seasonal time series analyses may fail to detect the intra-annual variations of water bodies. Sentinel-2 allows us to investigate water resources based on both spatial and temporal high-resolution analyses. We propose a new automatic RBSP approach on the Google Earth Engine platform. The RBSP method employs combined spectral indices and superpixel techniques to delineate the surface water extent; this approach avoids the need for training data and benefits large-scale, dynamic and automatic monitoring. We used the proposed RBSP method to process Sentinel-2 monthly composite images covering a two-year period and generate the monthly surface water extent at the national scale, i.e., over France. Annual occurrence maps were further obtained based on the pixel frequency in monthly water maps. The monthly dynamics provided in SWDF products are evaluated by HR satellite-derived water masks at the national scale (JRC GSW monthly water history) and at local scales (over two lakes, i.e., Lake Der-Chantecoq and Lake Orient, and 200 random sampling points). The monthly trends between SWDF and GSW were similar, with a coefficient of 0.94. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on the sample points were 0.885 (producer's accuracy), 0.963 (user's accuracy), 0.932 (overall accuracy) and 0.865 (Matthews correlation coefficient). The annual surface water extents (i.e., permanent and maximum) are validated by two HR satellite image-based water maps and an official database at the national scale and small water bodies (ponds) at the local scale at Loir-et-Cher. The results show that the SWDF results are closely correlated to the previous annual water extents, with a coefficient >0.950. The SWDF results are further validated for large rivers and lakes, with extraction rates of 0.929 and 0.802, respectively. Also, SWDF exhibits superiority to GSW in small water body extraction (taking 2498 ponds in Loir-et-Cher as example), with an extraction rate improved by approximately 20%. Thus, the SWDF method can be used to study interannual, seasonal and monthly variations in surface water systems. The monthly dynamic maps of SWDF improved the degree of land surface coverage by 25% of France on average compared with GSW, which is the only product that provides monthly dynamics. Further harmonization of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and the introduction of enhanced cloud detection algorithm can fill some gaps of no-data regions.

Training data requirements for fire severity mapping using Landsat imagery and random forest,"The ability to map fire severity is a requirement for fire management agencies worldwide. The development of repeatable methods to produce accurate and consistent fire severity maps from satellite imagery is necessary to document fire regimes, to set priorities for post-fire management responses, and for research applications. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest, have shown great promise for mapping of wildfire severity in woodland and forest ecosystems using satellite imagery. However, an assessment of the properties of training data required for automated mapping with random forest is currently lacking. This study examined how training data properties affect fire severity classification across forest, woodland and shrubland communities of southern Australia. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine how sample size (i.e. number of training points and fire events) and sample imbalance affect classification accuracy; (ii) to determine whether models were transferrable across geographic regions; and (iii) to assess the need for classifiers for prescribed burns and wildfires. We sampled 33 wildfires and 57 prescribed burns occurring across southern Australia between 2006 and 2019, to derive an extensive dataset (n = 25, 350 points) suitable for model training and validation. Five fire severity classes were mapped across the forest, woodland and shrubland communities. Using independent spatial cross validation of wildfires, we found that a minimum of 300 sample points per severity class, sampled across at least ten independent fires, was sufficient to reach the upper threshold of classification accuracy for the five severity classes. Training datasets derived across broad environmental space or close (≤100 km) to the target fire (i.e. fire to be mapped) produced better predictions than those derived regionally and far (>100 km) from the target fire. Models trained on data derived from both wildfires and prescribed burns had similar overall accuracy as those trained only on data from the fire type being predicted. However, there were significant differences in accuracy between the models trained with wildfires, prescribed burns and combined datasets within some severity classes. The random forest classifier had an overall accuracy of ~88% for wildfires and ~68% for prescribed burns across the study fires. The discrepancy in accuracy between wildfires and burns was likely due to the poorer classification performance for low fire severity classes, the dominant severity classes in prescribed burns. Overall classification accuracy was relatively consistent across forest, woodland and shrubland communities within the study fires, indicating that the method is robust across the temperate forest biome of southern Australia. Our results demonstrate that consideration of training data properties, specifically the number of points and fires sampled, sample balance and the geographic source of sample data, will be important considerations for the automated mapping of fire severity using random forest classification and Landsat imagery.

A global analysis of the temporal availability of PlanetScope high spatial resolution multi-spectral imagery,"The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation is providing unprecedented global coverage, visible to near infrared, atmospherically corrected, 3 m imagery. The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non-coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as “standard” or as “test” quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as “standard” at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December–February) and spring (March–May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution."
Satellite-derived bathymetry using the ICESat-2 lidar and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets,"Accurate bathymetric data is essential for marine, coastal ecosystems, and related studies. In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10% of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies. Hence, In the future, with the help of free and open-access satellite data (i.e., ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 imagery), this approach can be extended to a larger scale to obtain bathymetric maps in the shallow water of coastal areas, surroundings of islands and reefs, and inland waters."
Extraction of connected river networks from multi-temporal remote sensing imagery using a path tracking technique,"Precise delineation of river networksisimportant for accurate hydrological and flood modelling.
3 Whilst remote sensing (RS) has showed great potential in monitoring hydrological changes
4 over space and time, the existing RS-based methods extract river networks based on local
5 morphologies and seldom take into account the overall hydrological connectivity of the rivers.
6 The existing methods also commonly neglect the effect of seasonal variation of water surfaces
7 and the existence of temporary water bodies, which deteriorate the precision of positioning river
8 networks. To address these challenges, a new two-stage method is developed to Extract
9 spatiotemporal variation of water surfaces based on Multi-temporal remote sensing Imagery
10 and Delineate connected river networks with improved accuracy (EMID method for short)
11 using a path tracking technique. The EMID method delineates connected river networks using
12 (a) multi-temporal imagery and a Random Forest model to synoptically map the location and
13 extent of water surfaces under different hydrological conditions, and (b) an optimization
14 algorithm to find best river paths based on water-occurrence frequency. Four drainage basins
15 with various river morphologies are considered to validate EMID. Comparing with alternative
16 methods, EMID method consistently produces river network results with improved accuracy in
17 terms of stream location, river coverage and network connectivity."
Canopy structure explains the relationship between photosynthesis and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence in crops,"Remote sensing of far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as an important
tool for studying gross primary productivity (GPP) at the global scale. However, the relationship
between SIF and GPP at the canopy scale lacks a clear mechanistic explanation. This is largely due to
the poorly characterized role of the relative contributions from canopy structure and leaf physiology
to the variability of the top-of-canopy, observed SIF signal. In particular, the effect of the canopy
structure beyond light absorption is that only a fraction (fesc) of the SIF emitted from all leaves in the
canopy can escape from the canopy due to the strong scattering of near-infrared radiation. We
combined rice, wheat and corn canopy-level in-situ datasets to study how the physiological and
structural components of SIF individually relate to measures of photosynthesis. At seasonal time
scales, we found a considerably strong positive correlation (R2=0.4-0.6) of fesc to the seasonal
dynamics of the photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUEP), while the estimated physiological SIF yield
was almost entirely uncorrelated to LUEP both at seasonal and diurnal time scales, with the partial
exception of wheat. Consistent with these findings, the canopy structure and radiation component of
SIF, defined as the product of APAR and fesc, explained the relationship of observed SIF to GPP and
even outperformed GPP estimation based on observed SIF at two of the three sites investigated.
These results held for both half-hourly and daily mean values. In contrast, the total emitted SIF,
obtained by normalizing observed SIF for fesc , improved only the relationship to APAR but
considerably decreased the correlation to GPP for all three crops. Our findings demonstrate the
dominant role of canopy structure in the SIF-GPP relationship and establish a strong, mechanistic link
between the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the relevant canopy structure
information contained in the SIF signal. These insights are expected to be useful in improving remote
sensing based GPP estimates. "
Three decades of variability in California's giant kelp forests from the Landsat satellites,"Global, repeat satellite imagery serves as an essential tool to understand ecological patterns and processes over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Recently, the use of spaceborne imagery has become indispensable for monitoring giant kelp, a globally distributed foundation species that displays variable seasonal and interannual dynamics. In order to develop and maintain a continuous and spatially expansive time series, we describe a fully automated protocol to classify giant kelp canopy biomass across three Landsat sensors. This required correcting kelp canopy estimates to account for changes in the spectral response functions between the three sensors by simulating data using hyperspectral imagery. Combining multiple sensors also necessitated the use of an extended (15 year) time series of diver estimated kelp biomass to validate each sensor. We also describe a novel gap filling technique using known spatial scales of kelp biomass synchrony to correct for missing data due to the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector failure. These developments have led to a publicly available 34-year, seasonal time series of kelp canopy biomass across ~1500 km of California coastline.

We then use this time series to examine the role of temporal and spatial scale on the detection of long-term biomass trends. We found that kelp canopy biomass trends are associated with trends in low frequency marine climate oscillations, like the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Long-term (~20 year) increases in the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have led to a cooler, nutrient-rich environment that benefits the growth of giant kelp across a large portion of the kelp biomass time series, however recent warming events have led to weak, or nonexistent trends over the length of the time series. The cyclical nature of these low frequency marine climate oscillations complicates the detection of trends that may be associated with anthropogenic climate change. A longer and continuous time series is needed to analyze long-term canopy biomass trends outside of natural low frequency climate variability for giant kelp ecosystems along the coast of California, if we are to make accurate assessments of the impacts of climate change."
Sea surface salinity estimates from spaceborne L-band radiometers: An overview of the first decade of observation (2010–2019),"Operated since the end of 2009, the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission is the first orbiting radiometer that collects regular and global observations from space of two Essential Climate Variables of the Global Climate Observing System: Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and Soil Moisture. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aquarius mission, with the primary objective to provide global SSS measurements from space operated from mid-2011 to mid-2015. NASA's Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, primarily dedicated to soil moisture measurements, but also monitoring SSS, has been operating since early 2015. The primary sensors onboard these three missions are passive microwave radiometers operating at 1.4 GHz (L-band). SSS is retrieved from radiometer measurements of the sea surface brightness temperature (TB). In this paper, we first provide a historical review of SSS remote sensing with passive L-band radiometry beginning with the discussions of measurement principles, technology, sensing characteristics and complementarities of the three aforementioned missions. The assessment of satellite SSS products is then presented in terms of individual mission characteristics, common algorithms, and measurement uncertainties, including the validation versus in situ data, and, the consideration of sampling differences between satellite SSS and in situ salinity measurements. We next review the major scientific achievements of the combined first 10 years of satellite SSS data, including the insights enabled by these measurements regarding the linkages of SSS with the global water cycle, climate variability, and ocean biochemistry. We also highlight the new ability provided by satellites to monitor mesoscale and synoptic-scale SSS features and to advance our understanding of SSS' role in air-sea interactions, constraining ocean models, and improving seasonal predictions. An overview of satellite SSS observation highlights during this first decade and upcoming challenges are then presented."
Continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on Landsat time series,"We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45° to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or “breaks”) contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%."

Reconstruction of daytime land surface temperatures under cloud-covered conditions using integrated MODIS/Terra land products and MSG geostationary satellite …,"There is considerable demand for satellite observations that can support spatiotemporally continuous mapping of land surface temperature (LST) because of its strong relationships with many surface processes. However, the frequent occurrence of cloud cover induces a large blank area in current thermal infrared-based LST products. To effectively fill this blank area, a new method for reconstructing the cloud-covered LSTs of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime observations is described using random forest (RF) regression approach. The high temporal resolution of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) LST product assisted in identifying the temporal variations in cloud cover. The cumulative downward shortwave radiation flux (DSSF) was estimated as the solar radiation factor for each MODIS pixel based on the MSG DSSF product to represent the impact from cloud cover on incident solar radiation. The RF approach was used to fit an LST linking model based on the datasets collected from clear-sky pixels that depicted the complicated relationship between LST and the predictor variables, including the surface vegetation index (the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index), normalized difference water index, solar radiation factor, surface albedo, surface elevation, surface slope, and latitude. The fitted model was then used to reconstruct the LSTs of cloud-covered pixels. The proposed method was applied to the Terra/MODIS daytime LST product for four days in 2015, spanning different seasons in southwestern Europe. A visual inspection indicated that the reconstructed LSTs thoroughly captured the distribution of surface temperature associated with surface vegetation cover, solar radiation, and topography. The reconstructed LSTs showed similar spatial pattern according to the comparison with clear-sky LSTs from temporally adjacent days. In addition, evaluations against Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH 0.25° 3-h LST data and reference LST data derived based on in-situ air temperature measurements showed that the reconstructed LSTs presented a stable and reliable performance. The coefficients of determination derived with the GLDAS LST data were all above 0.59 on the four examined days. These results indicate that the proposed method has a strong potential for reconstructing LSTs under cloud-covered conditions and can also accurately depict the spatial patterns of LST."
Decadal vegetation succession from MODIS reveals the spatio-temporal evolution of post-seismic landsliding after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake,"Strong earthquakes, especially in continental mountainous areas, can trigger extensive mass wasting, producing large amounts of debris that accumulates along the hillslopes or in drainage channels. The coseismic deposits and disturbed slopes are prone to be reactivated or remobilized by heavy rainfalls in the subsequent years after the earthquake. Predicting how long post-seismic landslide activity will return to the pre-earthquake level is a key to risk assessment and management. However, this is still poorly understood, and lacks quantitative prediction approach. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake triggered an unprecedented number of landslides, creating an extraordinary natural laboratory to investigate the evolution of post-seismic landslides and their impacts on environment. Using the vegetation recovery rate as an indicator, we present the observational evidence of the post-seismic landslide evolution based on MODIS NDVI time series between 2000 and 2018. Using a simple vegetation recovery rate (VRR) function, we quantify the rate of vegetation regrowth in the Wenchuan earthquake affected area, and discuss the decaying trend of post-seismic landslide activities. Our findings show that 83% of the co-seismic landslides become inactive within a decade. The NDVI trend suggests that landslide activity may return to the pre-earthquake level within 18 years. The sensitivity of vegetation regrowth to post-seismic landsliding thus offers a great potential to improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal evolution of the post-seismic landslide activities."
Soil moisture experiment in the Luan River supporting new satellite mission opportunities,"The Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR) was conducted from 2017 to 2018 in the semi-arid
Luan River watershed located in the North of China. One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment
tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite (TWRS) concept with one-dimensional
synthetic aperture microwave techniques, for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing
configurations (mainly in terms of incidence angels) is the greatest challenge. This proposed mission is targeted
to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy
and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote
sensing data. Multi-resolution, multi-angle and multi-spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70
km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin, and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the
Xiaoluan River basin. The near surface soil moisture (0 cm–5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in
fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200
m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous
measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in
the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground
temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and

backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observa-
tions. Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that (1) the near surface soil moisture spatial

variability at a 200 m scale was up to ~0.1 cm3

/cm3 at an intermediate value of ~0.35 cm3
/cm3
. (2) The
difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar
noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M. (3) Both the airborne and ground measurements cover a wide range of conditions. The L-band active and passive observations exhibit a large
variation of ~30 dB and ~80 K, respectively, corresponding to soil moisture range from 0.1 cm3

/cm3 to 0.5 cm3

. The sensitivity of both active and passive data to soil moisture is compared at corresponding spatial re-
solutions and show high information complementarity for better accuracy and resolution soil moisture retrieval."
In-situ and triple-collocation based evaluations of eight global root zone soil moisture products,"Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is a vital variable for vegetation growth, drought monitoring and agricultural water management. Satellite remote sensing measures soil moisture at the surface layer, while RZSM is derived usually by model-based simulations. Here, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of eight RZSM products at a global scale, including GLDAS NOAH, ERA-5, MERRA-2, NCEP R1, NCEP R2, JRA-55, SMAP level 4 and SMOS level 4 datasets. An in-situ validation based on the stations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and a triple collocation (TC) evaluation are both conducted to assess the accuracy of these RZSM products. SMAP exhibits the median highest correlation and the median lowest RMSE with in-situ stations over North America. In the TC analysis, MERRA-2 shows the highest median correlation and the median lowest error standard deviation with the unknown truth, followed by GLDAS, SMAP, JRA-55 and ERA-5. A temporal pattern analysis indicates that SMOS has a dry bias relative to other datasets and NCEP R1 has larger seasonal variations relative to other datasets over Asia and North America. The TC analysis indicates that MERRA-2, SMAP, GLDAS, JRA-55, and ERA-5 have better performance relative to other datasets. SMAP is not as good as GLDAS, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 in RZSM estimation over forest areas. The possible factors influencing RZSM performance are discussed, including precipitation forcing, assimilated observations, radio frequency interference issue and validation methods. These results and conclusions may provide new insights for the improvement of model-based RZSM estimation."
The application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to estimate above-ground biomass of mangrove ecosystems,"Mangrove ecosystems are targeted for many conservation and rehabilitation efforts due to their ability to store
large amounts of carbon in their living biomass and soil. Traditional methods to monitor above-ground biomass
(AGB) rely on on-ground measurements, which are expensive, labour intensive and cover small spatial scales.
Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo reconstructions from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles imagery (UAVSfM) have the potential to increase fieldwork efficiency by providing a greater amount of spatial information in
less time. However, there is still a need to assess the ability of UAV-SfM to retrieve structural information of
mangrove forests, which could pose challenges in areas of high forest complexity and density.
In this study we successfully used UAV-SfM data to estimate height, canopy diameter and AGB of natural and
rehabilitated mangrove forests across two regions of the southeastern coast of Australia. We used a variable
window filter algorithm to detect trees with an 80% detection rate when considering the top canopy. Individual
tree canopy segmentation was performed using a marker-controlled watershed segmentation with two sets of
constraining markers: treetops and a minimum height below which a pixel is not considered part of a tree.
Direct comparison with on-ground measurements at the regional level showed no significant difference in tree
height and AGB medians when only top canopy was considered. Similarly, median canopy diameters were not
significantly different in natural areas of both regions, but significant differences were found in rehabilitated
areas. UAV-SfM estimates of AGB were on average 15% lower in natural areas and 10% higher in rehabilitated
areas when compared to on-ground measurements and followed a strong linear relationship close to the ideal
one-to-one relationship.
Additionally, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of the two methodologies. UAV-SfM methods can save
almost AU$ 50,000 per ha when compared to on-ground measurements and become cost-effective (based on
total costs) after just 15 days of surveys. The methods described in this study open the possibility for easily
repeatable, low-cost UAV-SfM surveys for local managers by providing a faster, more cost-effective approach for
monitoring mangrove forests over larger areas than traditional on-ground surveys while maintaining forest
inventory data accuracy in both natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests."
Cloud detection algorithm for multi-modal satellite imagery using convolutional neural-networks (CNN),"Cloud detection algorithms are crucial in many remote-sensing applications to allow an optimized processing of the acquired data, without the interference of the cloud fields above the surfaces of interest (e.g., land, coral reefs, etc.). While this is a well-established area of research, replete with a number of cloud detection methodologies, many issues persist for detecting clouds over areas of high albedo surfaces (snow and sand), detecting cloud shadows, and transferring a given algorithm between observational platforms. Particularly for the latter, algorithms are often platform-specific with corresponding rule-based tests and thresholds inherent to instruments and applied corrections. Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the detection of cloud and cloud shadow fields in multi-channel satellite imagery from World-View-2 (WV-2) and Sentinel-2 (S-2), using their Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared (RGB, NIR) channels. This algorithm is developed within the NASA NeMO-Net project, a multi-modal CNN for global coral reef classification which utilizes imagery from multiple remote sensing aircraft and satellites with heterogeneous spatial resolution and spectral coverage. Our cloud detection algorithm is novel in that it attempts to learn deep invariant features for cloud detection utilizing both the spectral and the spatial information inherent in satellite imagery. The first part of our work presents the CNN cloud and cloud shadow algorithm development (trained using WV-2 data) and its application to WV-2 (with a cloud detection accuracy of 89%) and to S-2 imagery (referred to as augmented CNN). The second part presents a new domain adaptation CNN-based approach (domain adversarial NN) that allows for better adaptation between the two satellite platforms during the prediction step, without the need to train for each platform separately. Our augmented CNN algorithm results in better cloud prediction rates as compared to the original S-2 cloud mask (81% versus 48%), but still, clear pixels prediction rate is lower than S-2 (81% versus 91%). Nevertheless, the application of the domain adaptation approach shows promise in better transferring the knowledge gained from one trained domain (WV-2) to another (S-2), increasing the prediction accuracy of both clear and cloudy pixels when compared to a network trained only by WV-2. As such, domain adaptation may offer a novel means of additional augmentation for our CNN-based cloud detection algorithm, increasing robustness towards predictions from multiple remote sensing platforms. The approach presented here may be further developed and optimized for global and multi-modal (multi-channel and multi-platform) satellite cloud detection capability by utilizing a more global dataset."
From parcel to continental scale–A first European crop type map based on Sentinel-1 and LUCAS Copernicus in-situ observations,"Detailed parcel-level crop type mapping for the whole European Union (EU) is necessary for the evaluation of agricultural policies. The Copernicus program, and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99 (rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here can underpin the operational delivery of in-season high-resolution based crop mapping."
Mapping global forest canopy height through integration of GEDI and Landsat data,"Consistent, large-scale operational monitoring of forest height is essential for estimating forest-related carbon emissions, analyzing forest degradation, and quantifying the effectiveness of forest restoration initiatives. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar instrument onboard the International Space Station has been collecting unique data on vegetation structure since April 2019. Here, we employed global Landsat analysis-ready data to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements, creating a 30 m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map for the year 2019. The global forest height map was compared to the GEDI validation data (RMSE = 6.6 m; MAE = 4.45 m, R2 = 0.62) and available airborne lidar data (RMSE = 9.07 m; MAE = 6.36 m, R2 = 0.61). The demonstrated integration of GEDI data with time-series optical imagery is expected to enable multidecadal historic analysis and operational forward monitoring of forest height and its dynamics. Such capability is important to support global climate and sustainable development initiatives."
Validation of ICESat-2 terrain and canopy heights in boreal forests,"NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) launched in the fall of 2018 and is collecting vegetation canopy height and terrain measurements globally. In this paper we validate the terrain and canopy heights estimated from 11 months of ICESat-2 data using airborne lidar data collected in southern Finland. Overall, the terrain heights from the ATL08 data product agreed with the airborne lidar with vertical errors less than 75 cm (mean = −0.07 m; MAE = 0.53 m, RMSE = 0.73 m; n observations = 909,467). ATL08 terrain heights had positive bias (33 cm) when permanent snow cover was present compared to the airborne lidar. Canopy heights derived from ICESat-2 varied significantly by the beam selection (i.e. strong versus weak). Use of the weak beams increased the underestimation of canopy height by 1.06 m and increased RMSE% by 8.08%. The lowest canopy height errors were associated with strong beam/night/summer ATL08 acquisitions, which underestimated canopy height by 0.56 m (Bias% = 3.18; RMSE% of 13.75%), followed by strong beam/day/summer acquisitions (Bias% = 2.85%; RMSE% = 14.77%). For this study area with managed, coniferous-dominated boreal forests, we found that ATL08 canopy height errors were lowest for canopy cover ranging from 40 to 85% and within this range, we found that on average, ICESat-2 missed the top 11–13% of canopy heights. At low canopy cover (<40%), photons are more likely to be reflected from the terrain surface rather than the canopy due to the lower amount of vegetation present. Although not designed for canopy height retrievals, herein we have demonstrated that ICESat-2 can provide a useful source of canopy height information in boreal forests. By quantifying the accuracy with which terrain and canopy heights are characterized by ATL08, we provide insights on the capabilities and limitations of these data for these applications. Our results indicate that end users interested in canopy height retrievals in particular should avoid the use of weak beam data in boreal forest conditions."
Mapping cropping intensity in China using time series Landsat and Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine,"Cropping intensity has undergone dramatic changes worldwide due to the effects of climate changes and human
management activities. Cropping intensity is an important factor contributing to crop production and food security at local, regional and national scales, and is a critical input data variable for many global climate, land
surface, and crop models. To generate annual cropping intensity maps at large scales, Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at 500-m or 250-m spatial resolution have problems with mixed
land cover types within a pixel (mixed pixel), and Landsat images at 30-m spatial resolution suffer from low
temporal resolution (16-day). To overcome these limitations, we developed a straightforward and efficient pixeland phenology-based algorithm to generate annual cropping intensity maps over large spatial domains at high
spatial resolution by integrating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time series image data for 2016–2018 using the Google
Earth Engine (GEE) platform. In this pilot study, we report annual cropping intensity maps for 2017 at 30-m
spatial resolution over seven study areas selected according to agro-climatic zones in China. Based on field-scale
sample data, the annual cropping intensity maps for the study areas had overall accuracy rates of 89–99%, with
Kappa coefficients of 0.76–0.91. The overall accuracy of the annual cropping intensity maps was 93%, with a
Kappa coefficient of 0.84. These cropping intensity maps can also be used to enable identification of various crop
types from phenological information extracted from the growth cycle of each crop. These algorithms can be
readily applied to other regions in China to generate annual cropping intensity maps and quantify inter-annual
cropping intensity variations at the national scale with a greatly improved accuracy."
Evaluation of global leaf area index and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation products over North America using Copernicus Ground Based …,"With a growing number of Earth observation (EO) products available through operational programmes such as the European Union’s Copernicus, there is increasing emphasis on product accuracy and uncertainty, necessitating evaluation against in situ reference measurements. Whilst existing reference datasets have proven a valuable resource, they incorporate little data with which products from recent EO instruments can be assessed. A reliance on individual field campaigns has also led to several inconsistencies, whilst limiting the extent to which temporal variations in EO product performance can be captured. Recently established environmental monitoring networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which collect routine in situ measurements using standardised instruments and protocols, provide a promising opportunity in this respect. The Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) service was initiated in recognition of this fact. In the first component of the project, raw observations from existing networks have been collected and processed to provide reference data for a range of EO land products. In this study, we focus on leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). Raw digital hemispherical photography (DHP) from twenty NEON sites was processed to derive in situ reference measurements, which were then upscaled to provide high spatial resolution reference maps. Using these data, we assess the recently released Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) 300 m Version 1 (V1) products derived from PROBA-V, in addition to existing products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). When evaluated against reference data, the CGLS 300 m V1 product demonstrated the best agreement (RMSD = 0.57 for LAI and 0.08 for FAPAR), followed by the Collection 6 VNP15A2H and MOD15A2H products (RMSD = 0.81 to 0.89 for LAI and 0.12 for FAPAR). Differing assumptions of the products and in situ reference measurements, which cause them to be sensitive to slightly different quantities, are thought to explain apparent biases over sparse vegetation and forest environments. To ensure their continued utility, future work should focus on updating the GBOV in situ reference measurements, implementing additional corrections, and improving their geographical representativeness.

Mapping erosion and deposition in an agricultural landscape: Optimization of UAV image acquisition schemes for SfM-MVS,"Structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms coupled with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a popular tool in the geosciences for modelling complex landscapes on-demand allowing for high-resolution topographic change-detection studies to be conducted at minimal cost. To identify the effects of UAV image orientation on the accuracy of SfM-MVS 3D surface models, we tested four different UAV image acquisition schemes that incorporated both nadir and oblique imagery of an agricultural field. The coupling of nadir and oblique imaging angles led to the highest surface model accuracy in the absence of ground control points (GCPs; vertical RMSE: 0.047 m, horizontal RMSE: 0.019 m), while with a normative distribution of GCPs the nadir-only image sets had similar accuracy metrics (vertical RMSE 0.028 m, horizontal RMSE 0.017 m) to surface models generated with nadir and oblique imaging angles (vertical RMSE 0.028 m, horizontal RMSE 0.013 m). Homologous keypoint matching between nadir and oblique imagery was poor when the survey conditions were bright and the surface texture of the field was homogeneous, leading to broad-scale vertical noise in the generated surface models. Results indicate that a nadir-only image set accompanied with a dense deployment of GCPs is the most ideal for SfM-MVS agricultural 3D surface reconstructions. The diachronic analysis of surface models generated from nadir-only image sets were able to detect surface-change >0.040 m in depth (i.e., rill and gully erosion, depositional zones) and were comparable to results obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner. Stable GCPs should be used where possible to ensure precise co-registration between subsequent UAV surveys."
Retrievals of soil moisture and vegetation optical depth using a multi-channel collaborative algorithm,"Due to the success of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) missions, new satellite missions are on the horizon. The current and future missions can benefit from investigations that seek to improve retrieval algorithms that quantitatively map global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (tau) from Earth's microwave emissions. In this study, we explore multi-angular and multi-frequency approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture and vegetation tau, considering the payload configurations of current and future satellite missions (such as the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer, the Water Cycle Observation Mission, and the Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite) using a new set of ground observations. Two ground-based microwave radiometry datasets collected in Inner Mongolia during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River from July to August 2017 (cropland) and August to September 2018 (grassland) are used for this study. The corn field, which covers an entire growth period, indicated that the degree of information increases linearly as the number of channels (in terms of the incidence angle and frequency) increases, and that the multi-frequency observations contain slightly more independent information than do the multi-angular observations under the same number of channels. The polarization difference in brightness temperature is sensitive to both soil moisture and vegetation water content, especially at L-band due to its penetrating ability. Soil moisture explains most of the variance in frequency differences of brightness temperature at adjacent frequencies (L- & C-bands, C- & X-bands), while the variance in incidence-angle differences of brightness temperature is mostly associated with the vegetation water content. A multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA) is developed based on the two-component version of the omega-tau model, which utilizes information from collaborative channels expressed as an analytical form of brightness temperature at the core channel to rule out the parameters to be retrieved. Results of soil moisture retrieval show that the multi-angular approach used by the MCCA generally has a better performance, unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) varying from 0.028 cm3/cm3 to 0.037 cm3/cm3, than the multi-frequency approach (ubRMSD from 0.028 cm3/cm3 to 0.089 cm3/cm3) for the corn field. This is attributed to the dependence of vegetation tau on the frequency being more significant than that on the incidence angle. Except for in the C- & X-band combination, the multi-frequency approach used by the MCCA performs better (ubRMSD from 0.018 cm3/cm3 to 0.023 cm3/cm3) than the multi-angular version (ubRMSD from 0.026 cm3/cm3 to 0.034 cm3/cm3) for the grass field due to reduced vegetation effects for this type of cover. It is affirmed that increasing the number of observation channels could make the soil moisture retrieval more robust, but might also limit the retrieval performance, as the probability that the model estimations will not match the observations is increased. This study provides new insights into the design of potential satellite missions to improve soil moisture retrieval. A satellite with simultaneous multi-angular and multi-frequency observation capabilities is highly recommended."
NIRVP: A robust structural proxy for sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis across scales,"Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a promising new tool for remotely estimating photosynthesis. However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf physiology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships between SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRVP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRVP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRVP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRVP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRVP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF."
Mapping and sampling to characterize global inland water dynamics from 1999 to 2018 with full Landsat time-series,"Global surface water extent is changing due to natural processes as well as anthropogenic drivers such as reservoir construction and conversion of wetlands to agriculture. However, the extent and change of global inland surface water are not well quantified. To address this, we classified land and water in all 3.4 million Landsat 5, 7, and 8 scenes from 1999 to 2018 and performed a time-series analysis to produce maps that characterize inter-annual and intra-annual open surface water dynamics. We also used a probability sample and reference time-series classification of land and water for 1999–2018 to provide unbiased estimators of area of stable and dynamic surface water extent and to assess the accuracy of the surface water maps. From the reference sample data, we estimate that permanent surface water covers 2.93 (standard error ±0.09) million km2, and during this time period an estimated 138,011 (±28,163) km2 underwent only gain of surface water, over double the estimated 53,154 (±10,883) km2 that underwent only loss of surface water. The estimated area of 950,719 (±104,034) km2 that experienced recurring change between land and water states is far greater than the area undergoing these unidirectional trends. From a probability sample of high resolution imagery, an estimated 10.9% (±1.9%) of global inland surface water is within mixed pixels at Landsat resolution indicating that monitoring of surface water changes requires improved spatial detail. We provide the first unbiased area estimators of open surface water extent and its changes with associated uncertainties and illustrate the challenges of tracking changes in surface water area using medium spatial and temporal resolution data."
Quantization of the coupling mechanism between eco-environmental quality and urbanization from multisource remote sensing data,"The rapid urbanization in central and eastern China has posed a major threat to the green sustainable devel-
opment of the ecological environment. However, the understanding of the interactive coupling mechanism be-
tween urbanization and eco-environmental quality (EEQ) remains to be developed. Understanding their

interactive coupling mechanism is of great significance to achieve the urban sustainable development goal. By

using multi-source remote sensing data, we intended to answer “What are the temporal and spatial character-
istics of urbanization and EEQ in the central and eastern regions of China on the pixel scale in the past 24 years,

and what is the coupling mechanism between the urbanization and the EEQ?”. To answer these questions, we
improved a pixel-based model (i.e., RSEI-2) to assess the EEQ in China and explored the coupling mechanism
between the urbanization and the EEQ in central and eastern China with the combination method of mathematics
and graphics. The results showed that the urbanization and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the whole
region continually increased from 1992 to 2015, especially in the three major urban agglomerations. The CCD of
the provinces in these regions exhibited a strong spatial dependence, with the spatial distribution pattern of “low
inside, high outside, high in the east and low in the west”. The EEQ did not change significantly, whilst the three
major urban agglomerations showed a significant downward trend. Most importantly, this study found that the
urbanization determined the development of the CCD lying within the critical value. In addition, the improved
RSEI-2 in this study provided great convenience for monitoring the EEQ in China. This study fills the gap in
studying the interaction mechanism between the urbanization and the EEQ, and also provides a new perspective
for the research on the urban sustainable development in China and even the world."
Rapid and robust monitoring of flood events using Sentinel-1 and Landsat data on the Google Earth Engine,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors represent an indispensable data source for flood disaster planners and
responders, given their ability to image the Earth's surface nearly independently of weather conditions and time
of day. The decision by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program to open data from its Sentinel-1
SAR satellites to the public marks the first time global, operational SAR data have been made freely available.

Combined with the emergence of cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this devel-
opment presents a tremendous opportunity to the disaster response community, for whom rapid access to

analysis-ready data is needed to inform effective flood disaster response interventions and management plans.
Here, we present an algorithm that exploits all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in combination with historical
Landsat and other auxiliary data sources hosted on the GEE to rapidly map surface inundation during flood
events. Our algorithm relies on multi-temporal SAR statistics to identify unexpected floods in near real-time.
Additionally, historical Landsat-based surface water class probabilities are used to distinguish unexpected floods
from permanent or seasonally occurring surface water. We assessed our algorithm over three recent flood events
using coincident very high- spatial resolution imagery and operational flood maps. Using very high resolution
optical imagery, we estimated an area-normalized accuracy of 89.8 ± 2.8% (95% c.i.) over Houston, Texas
following Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, representing an improvement of between 1.6% and 9.8% over

flood maps derived from a simple backscatter threshold. Additionally, comparison of our results with SAR-
derived Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps following devastating floods in Thessaly,

Greece and Eastern Madagascar in January and March 2018, respectively, yielded overall agreement rates of
98.5% in both cases. Importantly, our algorithm was able to ingest hundreds of SAR and optical images served on
the GEE to produce flood maps over affected areas within minutes, circumventing the need for time-consuming
data download and pre-processing steps. The flexibility of our algorithm will allow for the rapid processing of
future open-access SAR data, including data from future Sentinel-1 missions."
Review of GPM IMERG performance: A global perspective,"Accurate, reliable, and high spatio-temporal resolution precipitation data are vital for many applications, including the study of extreme events, hydrological modeling, water resource management, and hydroclimatic research in general. In this study, we performed a systematic review of the available literature to assess the performance of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products across different geographical locations and climatic conditions around the globe. Asia, and in particular China, are the subject of the largest number of IMERG evaluation studies on the continental and country level. When compared to ground observational records, IMERG is found to vary with seasons, as well as precipitation type, structure, and intensity. It is shown to appropriately estimate and detect regional precipitation patterns, and their spatial mean, while its performance can be improved over mountainous regions characterized by orographic precipitation, complex terrains, and for winter precipitation. Furthermore, despite IMERG's better performance compared to other satellite products in reproducing spatio-temporal patterns and variability of extreme precipitation, some limitations were found regarding the precipitation intensity. At the temporal scales, IMERG performs better at monthly and annual time steps than the daily and sub-daily ones. Finally, in terms of hydrological application, the use of IMERG has resulted in significant discrepancies in streamflow simulation. However, and most importantly, we find that each new version that replaces the previous one, shows substantial improvement in almost every spatiotemporal scale and climatic condition. Thus, despite its limitations, IMERG evolution reveals a promising path for current and future applications."
RF-MEP: A novel Random Forest method for merging gridded precipitation products and ground-based measurements,"The accurate representation of spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation is an essential input for numerous environmental applications. However, the estimation of precipitation patterns derived solely from rain gauges is subject to large uncertainties. We present the Random Forest based MErging Procedure (RF-MEP), which combines information from ground-based measurements, state-of-the-art precipitation products, and topography-related features to improve the representation of the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation, especially in data-scarce regions. RF-MEP is applied over Chile for 2000—2016, using daily measurements from 258 rain gauges for model training and 111 stations for validation. Two merged datasets were computed: RF-MEP3P (based on PERSIANN-CDR, ERA-Interim, and CHIRPSv2) and RF-MEP5P (which additionally includes CMORPHv1 and TRMM 3B42v7). The performances of the two merged products and those used in their computation were compared against MSWEPv2.2, which is a state-of-the-art global merged product. A validation using ground-based measurements was applied at different temporal scales using both continuous and categorical indices of performance. RF-MEP3P and RF-MEP5P outperformed all the precipitation datasets used in their computation, the products derived using other merging techniques, and generally outperformed MSWEPv2.2. The merged P products showed improvements in the linear correlation, bias, and variability of precipitation at different temporal scales, as well as in the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the critical success index for different precipitation intensities. RF-MEP performed well even when the training dataset was reduced to 10% of the available rain gauges. Our results suggest that RF-MEP could be successfully applied to any other region and to correct other climatological variables, assuming that ground-based data are available. An R package to implement RF-MEP is freely available online at https://github.com/hzambran/RFmerge."
Atmospheric correction of Sentinel-3/OLCI data for mapping of suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll-a concentration in Belgian turbid coastal waters,"The performance of different atmospheric correction algorithms for the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board of Sentinel-3 (S3) is evaluated for retrieval of water-leaving radiance reflectance, and derived parameters chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in turbid coastal waters in the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ). This is performed using in situ measurements from an autonomous pan-and-tilt hyperspectral radiometer system (PANTHYR). The PANTHYR provides validation data for any satellite band between 400 and 900 nm, with the deployment in the BCZ of particular interest due to the wide range of observed Near-InfraRed (NIR) reflectance. The Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction algorithm is adapted for S3/OLCI processing in ACOLITE, and its performance and that of 5 other processing algorithms (L2-WFR, POLYMER, C2RCC, SeaDAS, and SeaDAS-ALT) is compared to the in situ measured reflectances. Water turbidities across the matchups in the Belgian Coastal Zone are about 20–100 FNU, and the overall performance is best for ACOLITE and L2-WFR, with the former providing lowest relative (Mean Absolute Relative Difference, MARD 7–27%) and absolute errors (Mean Average Difference, MAD -0.002, Root Mean Squared Difference, RMSD 0.01–0.016) in the bands between 442 and 681 nm. L2-WFR provides the lowest errors at longer NIR wavelengths (754–885 nm). The algorithms that assume a water reflectance model, i.e. POLYMER and C2RCC, are at present not very suitable for processing imagery over the turbid Belgian coastal waters, with especially the latter introducing problems in the 665 and 709 nm bands, and hence the chlorophyll-a and turbidity retrievals. This may be caused by their internal model and/or training dataset not being well adapted to the waters encountered in the BCZ. The 1020 nm band is used most frequently by ACOLITE/DSF for the estimation of the atmospheric path reflectance (67% of matchups), indicating its usefulness for turbid water atmospheric correction. Turbidity retrieval using a single band algorithm showed good performance for L2-WFR and ACOLITE compared to PANTHYR for e.g. the 709 nm band (MARD 15 and 17%), where their reflectances were also very close to the in situ observations (MARD 11%). For the retrieval of chlorophyll-a, all methods except C2RCC gave similar performance, due to the RedEdge band-ratio algorithm being robust to typical spectrally flat atmospheric correction errors. C2RCC does not retain the spectral relationship in the Red and RedEdge bands, and hence its chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval is not at all reliable in Belgian coastal waters. L2-WFR and ACOLITE show similar performance compared to in situ radiometry, but due to the assumption of spatially consistent aerosols, ACOLITE provides less noisy products. With the superior performance of ACOLITE in the 490–681 nm wavelength range, and smoother output products, it can be recommended for processing of S3/OLCI data in turbid waters similar to those encountered in the BCZ. The ACOLITE processor for OLCI and the in situ matchup dataset used here are made available under an open source license."
Above-ground biomass mapping in West African dryland forest using Sentinel-1 and 2 datasets-A case study,"The Sudanian Savanna (SS) of West Africa is characterized by tropical savannas and woodlands. Accurate es-
timation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as

the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts

focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-
series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and

derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a
Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to
determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB
mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted
map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute
error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error.
Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1

(RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combi-
nation of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired

in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related
vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB
studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since
biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and
energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated
possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful
and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land
that is degraded over total land area). Further work on developing species-specific wood densities and allometric
equations is required to improve AGB and carbon stock estimation in the SS."
Mapping nature's contribution to SDG 6 and implications for other SDGs at policy relevant scales,"The natural world has multiple, sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic, values to society when viewed
through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Spatial mapping of nature's contributions to the
SDGs has the potential to support the implementation of SDG strategies through sustainable land management
and conservation of ecosystem services. Such mapping requires a range of spatial data. This paper examines the
use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature's contribution to targets under
SDG 6, also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade-offs with agriculture.

We use a wide range of remotely sensed and globally available datasets (for land cover, climate, soil, po-
pulation, agriculture) alongside the existing and widely used spatial ecosystem services assessment tool, Co

$tingNature. With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise targets under SDG 6
(water) at the country scale for Madagascar and at the basin scale for the Volta basin, though the application
developed can be applied to any country or major basin in the world. Within this SDG 6 priority areas footprint,
we assess the synergies and trade-offs provided by this land for SDG 15 (biodiversity) and SDG 13 (climate
action) as well as SDG 2 (zero hunger).

Results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature's contribution to SDG 6, such as the pro-
tection of forest cover (for SDG target 15.2), carbon storage as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and

nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (for SDG target 15.5) but also trade-offs with the
zero hunger goal (for SDG 2). Such analyses allow for better understanding of land management requirements
for realising multiple SDGs through protection and restoration of green infrastructure. We provide a freely
available tool, within the Co$tingNature platform, based on a variety of remotely sensed products, that can be
used by SDG practitioners to carry out similar analyses and inform decision-making at national or sub-national
levels globally."
The global distribution of leaf chlorophyll content,"Leaf chlorophyll is central to the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and the
40 atmosphere, and to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents the first spatially
41 continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content (ChlLeaf) across a global scale. Weekly maps of
42 ChlLeaf were produced from ENIVSAT MERIS full resolution (300 m) satellite data with a two-stage
43 physically-based radiative transfer modelling approach. Firstly, leaf-level reflectance was derived from
44 top-of-canopy satellite reflectance observations using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models
3
45 for woody and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled leaf-level reflectance was
46 used in the PROSPECT leaf-level radiative transfer model to derive ChlLeaf. The ChlLeaf retrieval algorithm
47 was validated with measured ChlLeaf data from 248 sample measurements at 28 field locations, and
48 covering six plant functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong relationships with field
measurements, particularly for deciduous broadleaf forests (R2
 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 µg cm-2 49 ; p<0.001),
croplands (R2
 = 0.41; RMSE = 13.18 µg cm-2; p<0.001) and evergreen needleleaf forests (R2 50 = 0.47; RMSE
= 10.63 µg cm-2 51 ; p<0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs were considered together, the
overall relationship with measured ChlLeaf remained good (R2
 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 µg cm-2 52 ; p<0.001).
53 This result was an improvement on the relationship between measured ChlLeaf and a commonly used
chlorophyll-sensitive spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI; R2 54 = 0.27,
55 p<0.001). The global maps show large temporal and spatial variability in ChlLeaf, with evergreen broadleaf
forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values with global annual median of 54.4 µg cm-2 56 . Distinct
57 seasonal ChlLeaf phenologies are also visible, particularly in deciduous plant forms, associated with
58 budburst and crop growth, and leaf senescence. It is anticipated that this global ChlLeaf product will make
59 an important step towards the explicit consideration of leaf-level biochemistry in terrestrial water,
60 energy and carbon cycle modelling"
Thematic accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2016 land cover for the conterminous United States,"The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) is an operational land cover monitoring program providing updated land cover and related information for the United States at five-year intervals. NLCD2016 extends temporal coverage to 15 years (2001–2016). We collected land cover reference data for the 2011 and 2016 nominal dates to report land cover accuracy for the NLCD2016 database 2011 and 2016 land cover components at Level II and Level I and for Level I 2011–2016 land cover change using two definitions of agreement. For both the 2011 and 2016 land cover components, single-date Level II overall accuracies (OA) were 72% (standard error of ±0.9%) when agreement was defined as match between the map label and primary reference label only and 86% (± 0.7%) when agreement also included the alternate reference label. The corresponding level I OA for both dates were 79% (± 0.9%) and 91% (± 1.0%). The 2011–2016 user's and producer's accuracies (UA and PA) were ~ 75% for forest loss and PA for water loss, grassland loss, and grass gain were > 70% when agreement included a match between the map label and either the primary or alternate reference label. Depending on agreement definition and level of the classification hierarchy, OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2016 database was about 4% to 7% higher than OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2011 database, suggesting that the changes in mapping methodologies initiated for production of the NLCD2016 database have led to improved product quality. Additionally, we used the reference dataset collected for assessment of the NLCD2011 database to assess the 2001 and 2006 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. OA for the 2001 and 2006 land cover components was 1% - 5% lower than OA for the 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. Higher OA for 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database relative to OA for its 2001 and 2006 components may be attributable to differences in reference data quality."
Sensitivity of six typical spatiotemporal fusion methods to different influential factors: A comparative study for a normalized difference vegetation index time series …,"Dozens of spatiotemporal fusion methods have been developed to reconstruct vegetation index time-series data
with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage for monitoring land surface dynamics. Although several
studies comparing the different fusion methods have been conducted, selecting the suitable fusion methods is
still challenging, as inevitable influential factors tend to be neglected. To address this problem, this study
compared six typical spatiotemporal fusion methods, including the Unmixing-Based Data Fusion (UBDF), Linear
Mixing Growth Model (LMGM), Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Fit-FC
(regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation), One Pair Dictionary-Learning method
(OPDL), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), based on simulation experiments and theoretical
analysis considering three influential factors between sensors: geometric misregistration, radiometric inconsistency, and spatial resolution ratio. The results indicate that Fit-FC achieved the best performance with the
strongest tolerance to geometric misregistration when radiometric inconsistency was negligible; thus, it is the
first recommended algorithm for blending normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) imagery. Instead, the
FSDAF could generate the best results if radiometric inconsistency was non-negligible. These findings could help
users determine the method that is appropriate for different remote sensing datasets, and provide guidelines for
developers in the future development of novel methods. "
"Continental drought monitoring using satellite soil moisture, data assimilation and an integrated drought index","Satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented information on near-surface soil moisture at a global scale, enabling a wide range of studies such as drought monitoring and forecasting. Data Assimilation (DA) has been recognized as an effective means to incorporate such observations into hydrologic models to better predict and forecast hydroclimatic variables. In this study, we use a recently developed Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM) approach to assimilate Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to provide more reliable topsoil layer moisture (0~–5 cm) over the entire Continental United States (CONUS). The EPFM outperformed an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in terms of correlations and the unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) with in situ measurements from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN). Also, we used a multivariate probability distribution based on a Copula function to integrate the posterior soil moisture, precipitation (from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)) and evapotranspiration (from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) information to develop a new integrated drought index, i.e. SPESMI. To validate the usefulness of the developed integrated drought index, we compared the drought events detected by this index with those reported by the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The results indicated a strong temporal consistency of the drought areas detected by our approach and the USDM over the entire period of study (April 2015 to June 2018). In addition to such promising results, we noticed that our approach could capture the flash drought in 2017 in the U.S. Northern Plains earlier than the USDM, and could identify some severe to extreme drought events that had been underestimated by the USDM. Moreover, the SPESMI has a high correlation with the yield loss of spring and winter wheat in the United States. This novel drought monitoring framework can serve as an independent and potentially complementary drought monitoring system."
Validation practices for satellite soil moisture retrievals: What are (the) errors?,"This paper presents a community effort to develop good practice guidelines for the validation of global coarse-scale satellite soil moisture products. We provide theoretical background, a review of state-of-the-art methodologies for estimating errors in soil moisture data sets, practical recommendations on data pre-processing and presentation of statistical results, and a recommended validation protocol that is supplemented with an example validation exercise focused on microwave-based surface soil moisture products. We conclude by identifying research gaps that should be addressed in the near future.

A spatio-temporal active-fire clustering approach for global burned area mapping at 250 m from MODIS data,"This paper presents the generation of a global burned area mapping algorithm using MODIS hotspots and near-infrared reflectance within ESA's Fire_cci project. The algorithm is based on a hybrid approach that combines MODIS highest resolution (250 m) near-infrared band and active fire information from thermal channels. The burned area is detected in two phases. In the first step, pixels with a high probability of being burned are selected in order to reduce commission errors. To do that, spatio-temporal active-fire clusters are created to determine adaptive thresholds. Finally, a contextual growing approach is applied from those pixels to the neighbouring area to fully detect the burned patch and reduce omission errors. The algorithm was used to obtain a time series of global burned area dataset (named FireCCI51), covering the 2001–2018 period. Validation based on 1200 sampled sites covering the period from 2003 to 2014 showed an average omission and commission errors of 67.1% and 54.4%. When using longer validation periods, the errors were found smaller (54.5% omission and 25.7% commission for the additional 1000 African sampled sites), which indicates that the product is negatively influenced by temporal reporting accuracy. The inter-comparison carried out with previous Fire_cci versions (FireCCI41 and FireCCI50), and NASA's standard burned area product (MCD64A1 c6) showed consistent spatial and temporal patterns. However, the new algorithm estimated an average BA of 4.63 Mkm2, with a maximum of 5.19 Mkm2 (2004) and a minimum of 3.94 Mkm2 (in 2001), increasing current burned area estimations. Besides, the new product was found more sensitive to detect smaller burned patches. This new product, called FireCCI51, is publicly available at: http://cci.esa.int/data, last accessed on September 2019.

Deep learning on edge: Extracting field boundaries from satellite images with a convolutional neural network,"Applications of digital agricultural services often require either farmers or their advisers to provide digital records of their field
boundaries. Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these
records which is time consuming, and would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of current field
boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods, presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we sought to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images
by proposing a data-driven, robust, general method and addressed this problem as a multi-task semantic segmentation problem. We
used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions
and conditioned inference to identify: 1) the extent of fields; 2) the field boundaries; and 3) the distance to the closest boundary. By
asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs, model performance and its generalisation can greatly improve. Next,
instance segmentation of individual fields can be achieved by post-processing the three model outputs, e.g., via thresholding or watershed segmentation. Using a single monthly composite image from Sentinel-2 as input, the model was highly accurate in mapping
field extent, field boundaries, and, consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a single-date image close
to the compositing period marginally decreased accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that, without recalibration, the
same model generalised well across resolutions, sensors, space and time. Building consensus by averaging model predictions from
at least four images acquired across the season is the key to coping with the temporal variations of accuracy. The convolutional
network is capable of learning complex hierarchical contextual features from the image to accurately detect field boundaries and
discard irrelevant boundaries, thereby outperforming conventional edge filters. By minimising over-fitting and image preprocessing
requirements, and by replacing local arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate the extraction of
individual crop fields at scale."
Continuous subpixel monitoring of urban impervious surface using Landsat time series,"A novel method called Continuous Subpixel Monitoring (CSM) was developed to map and monitor urban impervious surface change continuously at the subpixel level. Time series model of each pixel was first estimated based on clear Landsat observations between 2000 and 2014, and any land surface change was detected by the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. These coefficients and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of the estimated time series models were then employed as the inputs of random forest regressor. A few experiments with different combinations of variables and bands were explored to better construct random forest regression models. We successfully applied this algorithm to map subpixel urban impervious surface area (ISA%) and characterize its dynamics in Broome County, New York. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results and analyses. First, the integration of subpixel mapping technique and time series analysis in CSM can yield a relatively satisfactory ISA% result at one point in time. With higher precision and smaller bias, its mapping accuracy is better than that of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) percent developed imperviousness product, without using extensive auxiliary data, such as nighttime light image and transportation network. Second, the ISA% change of any time interval can be easily derived and detected by CSM with relatively high accuracy, which have the potential to generate sub-annual ISA% change products. Furthermore, this approach can detect not only urban expansion/intensification (ISA% gain), but also different patterns of urban transitions overtime, such as urban demolition/redevelopment to vegetation (ISA% loss), and surface modifications (no mechanical change). Finally, CSM works well in one of the cloudiest regions in the United States. This algorithm could provide a new direction to map and monitor percent urban impervious surface change in a reliable and efficient way, which also has the potential to apply to other land cover types (e.g., tree, shrub, and barren lands) at the subpixel level.

Phenology of short vegetation cycles in a Kenyan rangeland from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2,"The short revisit times afforded by recently-deployed optical satellite sensors that acquire 3–30 m resolution imagery provide new opportunities to study seasonal vegetation dynamics. Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km2 Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start- and end-of-season for the series using a 50% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of ~8 days for SOS50 and ~15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.

Improved change monitoring using an ensemble of time series algorithms,"An ensemble of time series algorithms improves land change monitoring. The methodology combines the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC; Zhu & Woodcock, 2014) and Cumulative Sum of Residuals (CUSUM) algorithms for break detection and the Chow Test (Chow, 1960) for removing false positives (or breaks in time series not representing land change). The algorithms included are based on fundamentally different approaches to change detection and therefore offer unique advantages. The ensemble, or the combination of the three algorithms, was applied to 3 Landsat scenes in the United States and the results were assessed based on their ability to correctly discern structural breaks from stable time periods. The CUSUM test was shown to detect significant breaks 84.18% of the time and the Chow Test correctly removed breaks in 87.4% of the breaks analyzed. The ensemble produced results with lower frequency of errors of omission and commission (Type-I and Type-II errors) than a single algorithm approach. These results indicate that using a combination of break detection algorithms can be an improvement over typical approaches that utilize only one algorithm."

Pan-tropical soil moisture mapping based on a three-layer model from CYGNSS GNSS-R data,"In this paper, an effective schematic is developed for estimating soil moisture (SM) from CYclone Global
Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data. Here, a three-layer model of air, vegetation cover, and soil is
considered. In practice, the surface reflectivity (Γ) along with its statistics derived from the CYGNSS data and the
ancillary vegetation opacity (τ) data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are employed. The expression for
empirically retrieving SM from τ, Γ and its corresponding statistics are determined through the linear regression
technique. The CYGNSS data collected over the land surfaces within ± 37° (latitude) during the whole year of
2018 are investigated. The reference SM data are obtained from SMAP, and are regarded as ground-truth in this
work. Validation and assessment are performed on the pan-tropical daily data collected throughout the annual
circle at a resolution of 36 × 36 km2
. Experimental evaluation demonstrates good consistency between the SM
derived from CYGNSS data and the ground-truth, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80 and a root-mean-square
error of 0.07 cm3
/cm3
. This method succeeds in providing SM estimations on a pan-tropical scale that does not
rely on ongoing knowledge of SM and merely employs the least ancillary data. Furthermore, the intense temporal and spatial coverages of CYGNSS SM results are also illustrated. The use of CYGNSS SM significantly
enhances the pan-tropical coverage of SMAP SM by about 22% on average. The satisfactory outcomes achieved
here prove CYGNSS as an efficient complementary tool for pan-tropical SM sensing on a daily basis."
Have satellite precipitation products improved over last two decades? A comprehensive comparison of GPM IMERG with nine satellite and reanalysis datasets,"The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) produces the latest generation of satellite precipitation estimates and has been widely used since its release in 2014. IMERG V06 provides global rainfall and snowfall data beginning from 2000. This study comprehensively analyzes the quality of the IMERG product at daily and hourly scales in China from 2000 to 2018 with special attention paid to snowfall estimates. The performance of IMERG is compared with nine satellite and reanalysis products (TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP, CHIRPS, SM2RAIN, ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA2). Results show that the IMERG product outperforms other datasets, except the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), which uses daily-scale station data to adjust satellite precipitation estimates. The monthly-scale station data adjustment used by IMERG naturally has a limited impact on estimates of precipitation occurrence and intensity at the daily and hourly time scales. The quality of IMERG has improved over time, attributed to the increasing number of passive microwave samples. SM2RAIN, ERA5, and MERRA2 also exhibit increasing accuracy with time that may cause variable performance in climatological studies. Even relying on monthly station data adjustments, IMERG shows good performance in both accuracy metrics at hourly time scales and the representation of diurnal cycles. In contrast, although ERA5 is acceptable at the daily scale, it degrades at the hourly scale due to the limitation in reproducing the peak time, magnitude and variation of diurnal cycles. IMERG underestimates snowfall compared with gauge and reanalysis data. The triple collocation analysis suggests that IMERG snowfall is worse than reanalysis and gauge data, which partly results in the degraded quality of IMERG in cold climates. This study demonstrates new findings on the uncertainties of various precipitation products and identifies potential directions for algorithm improvement. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite rainfall products."
Individual tree crown segmentation from airborne LiDAR data using a novel Gaussian filter and energy function minimization-based approach,"Accurate segmentation of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data remains a challenge for forest inventories. Although many ITC segmentation methods have been developed to derive tree crown information from airborne LiDAR data, these algorithms contain uncertainty in processing false treetops because of foliage clumps and lateral branches, overlapping canopies without clear valley-shape areas, and sub-canopy crowns with neighbouring trees that obscure their shapes from an aerial perspective. Here, we propose an approach to crown segmentation using computer vision theories applied in different forest types. First, a dual Gaussian filter was designed with automated adaptive parameter assignment and a screening strategy for false treetops. This preserved the geometric characteristics of sub-canopy trees while eliminating false treetops. Second, anisotropic water expansion controlled by the energy function was applied for accurate crown segmentation. This utilized gradient information from the digital surface model and explored the morphological structures of tree crown boundaries as analogous to the maximal valley height difference from surrounding treetops. We demonstrate the generality of our approach in the subtropical forests within China. Our approach enhanced the detection rate of treetops and ITC segmentation relative to the marker-controlled watershed method, especially in complicated intersections of multiple crowns. A high performance was demonstrated for three pure Eucalyptus plots (a treetop detection rate r ≥ 0.95 and crown width estimation R2 ≥ 0.90 for canopy trees; r ≥ 0.85 and R2 ≥ 0.88 for sub-canopy trees) and three plots dominated by Chinese fir (r ≥ 0.95 and R2 ≥ 0.87 for canopy trees; r ≥ 0.79 and R2 ≥ 0.83 for sub-canopy trees). Finally, in a relatively complex forest park containing a wide range of tree species and sizes, a high performance was also achieved (r = 0.93 and R2 ≥ 0.85 for canopy trees; r = 0.70 and R2 ≥ 0.80 for sub-canopy trees). Our method demonstrates that methods inspired by the computer vision theory can improve on existing approaches, providing the potential for accurate crown segmentation even in mixed forests with complex structures"
A review of urban physical environment sensing using street view imagery in public health studies,"Urban physical environments are the physical settings and built environments in neighbourhoods
and cities which provide places for human activities. Evidence suggests that there are substantial
associations between urban physical environments and various health outcomes, e.g. people’s
physical activities might be influenced by surrounding physical environments, thereby affecting
their health behaviours; more exposure to urban physical environments may benefit human
mental health. Street view imagery enables us to capture the landscape at eye-level, making it
a promising data source for observing and analysing the realistic dynamics of urban physical
environments. Compared with traditional in-person assessments and field observations, street
view imagery-based data collection is relatively time-effective and cost-effective. Researchers
from epidemiology, psychology, and geography have used street view imagery to quantify the
built environment and understand its impacts on public health. To summarize current research
trends, this paper systematically reviews the use of street view images for sensing urban environments in public health studies. Specifically, we describe the characteristics of street view imagery
and review the methodology for image processing and semantic understanding. We then summarize the challenges that remain for quantifying urban environments in terms of data and
methodology. Several future research directions that would benefit public health research and
practices are recommended in urban environment research."
Fluorescence Correction Vegetation Index (FCVI): A physically based reflectance index to separate physiological and non-physiological information in far-red sun …,"Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been used to track vegetation photosynthetic activity for improving estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) and detecting plant stress. There are both physical and
physiological controls of SIF measured at the surface and retrieved from remote sensing including satellite
observations. In order to accurately use SIF for monitoring of plant physiology, the effects of physically-based
radiation processes related to leaf and canopy structure, notably photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorption and SIF scattering and re-absorption, must be characterized. In this study, we investigate both PAR
absorption and SIF scattering processes and find that although it is difficult to quantify their effects individually
by using just reflectance, the combined effects of the two processes can be well approximated by a reflectance
index. This index, referred to as FCVI (Fluorescence Correction Vegetation Index), is defined as the difference
between near-infrared (NIR) and broad-band visible (VIS, 400–700 nm) reflectance acquired under identical suncanopy-observer geometry of the SIF measurements. The development of the index was based on the physical
connection between reflectance and far-red SIF, which was revealed by using the spectral invariant theory. The
utility of FCVI to correct far-red SIF for PAR absorption and scattering effects, thus improving the link to
photosynthesis, was tested with data from: (i) a field experiment for a growing season; and (ii) a numerical
experiment which included a number of scenarios generated by a radiative transfer model. For both the observations and simulations, the FCVI provided a promising estimate of the impact of the physically-based radiation processes on far-red SIF of moderately dense canopies (i.e., FCVI ≥ 0.18). Normalizing the TOC far-red
SIF by both the incident PAR (iPAR) and the FCVI provided a good estimate of the far-red fluorescence emission
efficiency of the canopies examined. This approach enhances our ability to generalize retrievals for vegetation
processes as they change through natural growth phases and seasons. Taken together, far-red SIF and FCVI may
enable the assessment of the light partitioning of vegetation canopies, an essential step to facilitate the use of farred SIF for tracking physiological processes."
A deep learning method for building height estimation using high-resolution multi-view imagery over urban areas: A case study of 42 Chinese cities,"Knowledge of building height is critical for understanding the urban development process. High-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details within urban areas, while they have not been applied to building height estimation over multiple cities and the feasibility of mapping building height at a fine scale (< 5 m) remains understudied. Multi-view satellite images can describe vertical information of buildings, due to the inconsistent response of buildings (e.g., spectral and structural variations) to different viewing angles, but they have not been employed to deep learning-based building height estimation. In this context, we introduce high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images to estimate building height at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. We propose a multi-spectral, multi-view, and multi-task deep network (called M3Net) for building height estimation, where ZY-3 multi-spectral and multi-view images are fused in a multi-task learning framework. A random forest (RF) method using multi-source features is also carried out for comparison. We select 42 Chinese cities with diverse building types to test the proposed method. Results show that the M3Net obtains a lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the RF, and the inclusion of ZY-3 multi-view images can significantly lower the uncertainty of building height prediction. Comparison with two existing state-of-the-art studies further confirms the superiority of our method, especially the efficacy of the M3Net in alleviating the saturation effect of high-rise building height estimation. Compared to the vanilla single/multi-task models, the M3Net also achieves a lower RMSE. Moreover, the spatial-temporal transferability test indicates the robustness of the M3Net to imaging conditions and building styles. The test of our method on a relatively large area (covering about 14,120 km2) further validates the scalability of our method from the perspectives of both efficacy and quality. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/lauraset/BuildingHeightModel."
Global retrieval of phytoplankton functional types based on empirical orthogonal functions using CMEMS GlobColour merged products and further extension …,"This study presents an algorithm for globally retrieving chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) from multi-sensor merged ocean color (OC) products or Sentinel-3A (S3) Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data from the GlobColour archive in the frame of the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The retrieved PFTs include diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, green algae and prokaryotic phytoplankton. A previously proposed method to retrieve various phytoplankton pigments, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), is investigated and adapted to retrieve Chl-a concentrations of multiple PFTs using extensive global data sets of in situ pigment measurements and matchups with satellite OC products. The performance of the EOF-based approach is assessed and cross-validated statistically. The retrieved PFTs are compared with those derived from diagnostic pigment analysis (DPA) based on in situ pigment measurements. Results show that the approach predicts well Chl-a concentrations of most of the mentioned PFTs. The performance of the approach is, however, less accurate for prokaryotes, possibly due to their general low variability and small concentration range resulting in a weak signal which is extracted from the reflectance data and corresponding EOF modes. As a demonstration of the approach utilization, the EOF-based fitted models based on satellite reflectance products at nine bands are applied to the monthly GlobColour merged products. Climatological characteristics of the PFTs are also evaluated based on ten years of merged products (2002−2012) through inter-comparisons with other existing satellite derived products on phytoplankton composition including phytoplankton size class (PSC), SynSenPFT, OC-PFT and PHYSAT. Inter-comparisons indicate that most PFTs retrieved by our study agree well with previous corresponding PFT/PSC products, except that prokaryotes show higher Chl-a concentration in low latitudes. PFT dominance derived from our products is in general well consistent with the PHYSAT product. A preliminary experiment of the retrieval algorithm using eleven OLCI bands is applied to monthly OLCI products, showing comparable PFT distributions with those from the merged products, though the matchup data for OLCI are limited both in number and coverage. This study is to ultimately deliver satellite global PFT products for long-term continuous observation, which will be updated timely with upcoming OC data, for a comprehensive understanding of the variability of phytoplankton composition structure at a global or regional scale.

A new land surface temperature fusion strategy based on cumulative distribution function matching and multiresolution Kalman filtering,"Fusing high-level passive microwave (PMW) LST and thermal infrared (TIR) LST products is a promising means of generating high-quality, all-weather land surface temperature (LST) data. In this paper, we propose a new fusion strategy for generating high-quality, all-weather LST data based on cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and multiresolution Kalman filtering (MKF). CDF matching was employed to improve the quality of the high-resolution (0.01°) LST data downscaled with the retrieved coarse-resolution (0.1°) PMW LST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature (BT) data set. The MKF approach was employed to produce high-quality, all-weather LST data by fusing the retrieved coarse-resolution AMSR2 LST and high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data sets filled with CDF-improved LST data. The spatial patterns in the high-resolution and coarse-resolution LST data were consistent after MKF fusion. The accuracy of coarse-resolution LST data was considerably improved. The biases, root mean square errors (RMSEs) and determination coefficients (R2) were 0.79–1.47 K, 3.0–3.82 K, 0.88–0.96, respectively. The RMSE of the fused coarse-resolution LST data decreased by 1.51 K/1.82 K and 1.81 K/1.39 K in daytime/nighttime in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Heihe River Basin (HRB) verification regions compared to the RMSE of the retrieved AMSR2 LST data. The accuracy of high-resolution LST data remained unchanged, but the spatial coverage was complete with exceptions at the orbital gaps. The bias, RMSE and R2 values of high-resolution LST data were − 0.91- -0.81 K, 3.02–3.32 K, and 0.93–0.97 under all-sky conditions in the TP and HRB verification regions, respectively. Compared to methods in the existing LST fusion studies, the proposed strategy has advantages in terms of LST data quality and validation accuracy. When both coarse-resolution and high-resolution LST data are missing, the spatial coverages of fused all-weather LST data are incomplete. We attempted to fill the vacancies in PMW LST data with the DINEOF method in advance and subsequently obtained spatially complete all-weather LST data."
Investigating ESA Sentinel-2 products' systematic cloud cover overestimation in very high altitude areas,"Cloud detection in optical remote sensing imagery is crucial because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in analyses. Almost all optical remote sensing data access portals rely to some degree on a cloud cover filter. Here we show that cirrus as well as opaque cloud cover in Sentinel-2 Level-1C (L1C) and Level-2A (L2A) imagery is systematically and significantly overestimated in very high altitude areas (e.g. Himalayas, Andes). We argue that this systematic bias is created by applying simple thresholds to single bands instead of using a multi-band spectral signature in the cloud detection process. This results in a lot of “hidden” data for very high altitude areas when each image's estimated cloud cover is used as an automated selection criterion for analysis (e.g. global analyses, cloud-free mosaic production). We show geographic locations exemplifying this overestimation, and compare the L1C and L2A cloud masks produced by ESA to cloud masks generated by an expert system that uses comprehensive spectral signatures, showing that reliable cloud estimations are possible in very high altitudes. Based on this comparison, we argue for changes to L1C and L2A cloud detection algorithms in order to improve initial querying and selection of big EO data, where reliable yet automated quality indicators are necessary to handle an overwhelming data volume and velocity. Our contribution raises awareness of potential bias when pre-selecting images based on reported cloud cover in very high altitude areas for researchers and users of Sentinel-2 imagery in the environmental domain."
Diagnosing spatial biases and uncertainties in global fire emissions inventories: Indonesia as regional case study,"Models of atmospheric composition rely on fire emissions inventories to reconstruct and project impacts of biomass burning on air quality, public health, climate, ecosystem dynamics, and land-atmosphere exchanges. Many such global inventories use satellite measurements of active fires and/or burned area from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, differences across inventories in the interpretation of satellite imagery, the emissions factors assumed for different components of smoke, and the adjustments made for small and obscured fires can result in large regional differences in fire emissions estimates across inventories. Using Google Earth Engine, we leverage 15 years (2003–2017) of MODIS observations and 6 years (2012–2017) of observations from the higher spatial resolution Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor to develop metrics to quantify five major sources of spatial bias or uncertainty in the inventories: (1) primary reliance on active fires versus burned area, (2) cloud/haze burden on the ability of satellites to “see” fires, (3) fragmentation of burned area, (4) roughness in topography, and (5) small fires, which are challenging to detect. Based on all these uncertainties, we devise comprehensive “relative fire confidence scores,” mapped globally at 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution over 2003–2017.

We then focus on fire activity in Indonesia as a case study to analyze how the choice of a fire emissions inventory affects model estimates of smoke-induced health impacts across Equatorial Asia. We use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and apply emissions of particulate organic carbon and black carbon (OC + BC smoke) from five global inventories: Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4s), Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1.5), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2), Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFEDv2.5r1), and Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEERv1.0-G1.2). We find that modeled monthly smoke PM2.5 in Singapore from 2003 to 2016 correlates with observed smoke PM2.5, with r ranging from 0.64–0.84 depending on the inventory. However, during the burning season (July to October) of high fire intensity years (e.g., 2006 and 2015), the magnitude of mean Jul-Oct modeled smoke PM2.5 can differ across inventories by >20 μg m−3 (>500%). Using the relative fire confidence metrics, we deduce that uncertainties in this region arise primarily from the small, fragmented fire landscape and very poor satellite observing conditions due to clouds and thick haze at this time of year. Indeed, we find that modeled smoke PM2.5 using GFASv1.2, which adjusts for fires obscured by clouds and thick haze and accounts for peatland emissions, is most consistent with observations in Singapore, as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Finally, we develop an online app called FIRECAM for end-users of global fire emissions inventories. The app diagnoses differences in emissions among the five inventories and gauges the relative uncertainty associated with satellite-observed fires on a regional basis."
A generalized approach based on convolutional neural networks for large area cropland mapping at very high resolution,"Timely and accurate delineation of the cropland extent over large area is crucial for operational agriculture monitoring and is also beneficial to address food security issues. Existing global datasets associated with cropland are limited by insufficient spatial resolution to properly represent areas with small parcel size distributions, and their less-than-ideal accuracies hamper application at regional and local scales. Diverse very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite systems are now available, offering sub-meter to five-meter resolution (e.g. Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and ZiYuan-3), and hence enabling explicit extraction of cropland areas from heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. This study presented a generalized methodology for operational cropland mapping at very high resolution using a deep convolutional neural network to automatically learn the robust and discriminative features. Specifically, we slightly modified the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and combined deep long-range features with shadow local features to provide predictions with high level of detail. We demonstrated the modified PSPNet (MPSPNet) over four province-wide study areas (Heilongjiang, Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangdong) with diverse agrosystems across China from north to south using multi-source very high spatial resolution satellite images (mainly Gaofen-1 supplemented with Gaofen-2 and ZiYuan-3), with the overall accuracies ranging from 89.99% to 92.31%. Moreover, we compared MPSPNet with other CNN models and investigated the its behavior by visualizing the learned features on different layers, indicating that combining low and high level features for final classification was an efficient and accurate strategy for cropland mapping because the former capture edge information related to object boundaries and the latter could learn long-range spatial dependencies that helped recognize croplands. The temporal transfer and spatial transfer assessments from the respects of qualitative and quantitative corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method. And the contrast to the traditional object-based classification method also demonstrated the advantages and strong generalization capabilities of MPSPNet in extracting cropland using VHSR remote sensed images. We compared our results with the current cropland maps generated from FROM-GLC10, which further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale cropland mapping at very high resolution.

Using deep learning to map retrogressive thaw slumps in the Beiluhe region (Tibetan Plateau) from CubeSat images,"Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are among the most dynamic landforms in permafrost areas, and their formation can be attributed to the thawing of ice-rich permafrost. The spatial distribution and impacts of RTSs on
the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood due to their remote location and the technical challenges of automatic
mapping. In this study, we innovatively applied DeepLabv3+, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm for semantic segmentation, to Planet CubeSat images, which are satellite images with high spatial and temporal
resolution. Our method allows us to automatically delineate 220 RTSs within an area of 5200 km2 with an
average precision of 0.541. The corresponding precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.863, 0.833, and 0.848 respectively, when the threshold of intersection over union is 0.5. Moreover, approximately 100 experiments on kfold cross-validation (k = 3, 5, and 10) and data augmentation show that our method is robust. And a test in a
different geographic area shows that the generalization of the trained model is very good. We find that (1) most
of the RTSs are small (areas < eight ha and perimeters < 2000 m) and (2) RTSs preferentially develop at locations with gentle slopes (four to eight degrees), and in areas lower than the surroundings (the mean topographic position index is − 0.17) and receiving less solar radiation (i.e., north-facing slopes). The results show
that the method can map RTSs automatically from Planet CubeSat images and can potentially be applied to
larger areas."
Comparing land surface phenology of major European crops as derived from SAR and multispectral data of Sentinel-1 and-2,"The frequent acquisitions of fine spatial resolution imagery (10 m) offered by recent multispectral satellite missions, including Sentinel-2, can resolve single agricultural fields and thus provide crop-specific phenology metrics, a crucial information for crop monitoring. However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the “Copernicus module” of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level."
Dual polarimetric radar vegetation index for crop growth monitoring using sentinel-1 SAR data,"Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has provided an unprecedented opportunity for crop monitoring due to its high revisit frequency and
wide spatial coverage. The dual-pol Sentinel-1 SAR data is being utilized for
the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as well as for other national projects, which aim to provide Sentinel derived information to support
crop monitoring networks. Among the several earth observation products
identified for agriculture monitoring, the vegetation status indicator is one of
the critical elements that require minimum end-user expertise. In literature,
several experiments usually utilize the backscatter intensities to characterize
crops. In this work, we jointly use both the scattered and received wave information to derive a new vegetation index (DpRVI) for Sentinel-1 dual-pol
(VV-VH) SAR data. The DpRVI is derived using the degree of polarization and the dominant normalized eigenvalue obtained from the 2 × 2 covariance
matrix. We assess the utility of this index as an indicator of plant growth dynamics over a test site in Carman, Canada. Among the various crops grown
in this region, in particular, we analyze growth stages of canola, soybean, and
wheat, considering their diverse canopy structures. A temporal analysis of
DpRVI with crop biophysical variables (viz., Plant Area Index – PAI, Vegetation Water Content – VWC, and dry biomass–DB) at different phenological
stages confirms its trend with plant growth dynamics. The DpRVI is compared for three crops with the cross and co-pol ratio (σ
0
VH/σ0
VV) and dual-pol
Radar Vegetation Index (RVI = 4σ
0
VH/(σ
0
VV + σ
0
VH)). Correlation analysis
with biophysical variables shows that the DpRVI outperforms the other two
vegetation indices with significant correlations coefficient for all three crops.
For canola, DpRVI indicated the highest correlation with its biophysical variables, having a coefficient of determination (R2
) of 0.79 (PAI), 0.82 (VWC),
and 0.75 (DB). Moreover, DpRVI showed a moderate correlation (R2 ' 0.6)
with the biophysical parameters of wheat and low biomass soybean.

Satellite data for the offshore renewable energy sector: synergies and innovation opportunities,"Can satellite data be used to address challenges currently faced by the Offshore Renewable Energy
(ORE) sector? What benefit can satellite observations bring to resource assessment and maintenance of ORE farms? Can satellite observations be used to assess the environmental impact
of offshore renewables leading towards a more sustainable ORE sector? This review paper faces
these questions presenting a holistic view of the current interactions between satellite and ORE
sectors, and future needs to make this partnerships grow. The aim of the work is to start the
conversation between these sectors by establishing a common ground. We present offshore needs
and satellite technology limitations, as well as potential opportunities and areas of growth. To
better understand this, the reader is guided through the history, current developments, challenges
and future of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy technologies. Then, an overview on satellite
observations for ocean applications is given, covering types of instruments and how they are used
to provide different metocean variables, satellite performance, and data processing and integration. Past, present and future satellite missions are also discussed. Finally, the paper focuses on
innovation opportunities and the potential of synergies between the ORE and satellite sectors.
Specifically, we pay attention to improvements that satellite observations could bring to standard
measurement techniques: assessing uncertainty, wind, tidal and wave conditions forecast, as well as
environmental monitoring from space. Satellite–enabled measurement of ocean physical processes
and applications for fisheries, mammals and birds, and habitat change, are also discussed in depth."
Satellite identification of atmospheric-surface-subsurface urban heat islands under clear sky,"The urban heat island (UHI) is a major topic in the study of urban climates. However, comprehensive research on
the atmospheric UHI (UHIAtm), surface UHI (UHISurf), and subsurface UHI (UHISub) simultaneously has yet not
been reported. Using the MODIS land surface temperature and atmospheric profile data during the 2010–2016
period, we investigated the diurnal, seasonal, and vertical variations of UHIAtm, UHISurf, and UHISub in Beijing.
The major findings include but are not limited to the following: As the altitude increases from 1000 hPa (near the
surface) to 700 hPa (~3 km), the daytime UHIAtm intensity in summer decreases piecewise linearly with a rapid
decline above 850 hPa (~1.5 km), while in spring and autumn it decreases after a slight increase in the lower

atmosphere. The nighttime UHIAtm intensity decreases approximately linearly in all seasons with a rapid (gra-
dual) decline in winter (summer). As the depth increases from the surface to ~0.2 m, the daytime intensity from

UHISurf to UHISub decreases in summer but increases in the other seasons, while the nighttime trends are opposite
to the daytime ones. The diurnal (seasonal) variation of UHISub intensity converges to the daily (annual) mean as
the depth reaches ~0.5 m (10 m). These new findings have theoretical and practical implications for in-depth
understanding of the urban thermal environment from the boundary layer to the subsurface."
Tracking annual changes of coastal tidal flats in China during 1986–2016 through analyses of Landsat images with Google Earth Engine,"Tidal flats (non-vegetated area), along with coastal vegetation area, constitute the coastal wetlands (intertidal zone) between high and low water lines, and play an important role in wildlife, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed all the available Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery (~44,528 images) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth. The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170 ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods: a stable period during 1986–1992, an increasing period during 1993–2001 and a decreasing period during 2002–2016. The resulting annual coastal tidal flats maps could be used to support sustainable coastal zone management policies that preserve coastal ecosystem services and biodiversity in China."
Integrating Google Earth imagery with Landsat data to improve 30-m resolution land cover mapping,"Land use and land cover maps provide fundamental information that has been used in different kinds of studies, ranging from climate change to city planning. However, despite substantial efforts in recent decades, large-scale 30-m land cover maps still suffer from relatively low accuracy in terms of land cover type discrimination (especially for the vegetation and impervious types), due to limits in relation to the data, method, and design of the workflow. In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 84.40% on the entire validation dataset in China, improving the previous state-of-the-art accuracies obtained by RF and SVM by 4.50% and 4.20%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km2 confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating features of datasets at different resolutions and the possibility to produce more reliable land cover maps."
"Present-day land subsidence rates, surface faulting hazard and risk in Mexico City with 2014–2020 Sentinel-1 IW InSAR","Among the fastest sinking cities globally, the metropolitan area of Mexico City is the target of an unprecedented satellite investigation based on over 300 Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometric Wide swath mode scenes acquired in 2014–2020. Two-pass differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and the parallelized Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) repeat-pass InSAR approach provide a complete account of spatial patterns, long-term trend and present-day settlement rates affecting the city. The 3D deformation field reveals that foremost is the role of the vertical velocity VU, with peaks of −38.7 cm/year in Nezahualcóyotl, −32.0 cm/year in Gustavo A. Madero and Venustiano Carranza, and −39.1 cm/year in Iztapalapa. Settlement at the metropolitan Cathedral in Cuauhtémoc is ongoing at up to −8.8 cm/year, consistently with the last six decades. Volcanic edifices mark ground stability “islets” inside the main subsidence bowls. East-west rates are limited, except for some horizontal strain (up to ±5 cm/year) within the subsidence bowls. Comparison with surface geology and geotechnical zoning confirms that aquitard compaction is the predominant process. The power relationship between VU [cm/year] and the thickness of lacustrine clay deposits HC [m] is: 
. The 2019–2020 deformation scenario shows that subsidence still involves most of Nezahualcóyotl, with −3.0 cm/month VU. A well-defined long-term deformation behaviour comes out from 2014–2019 InSAR time series and comparison with 2008–2020 GPS data. RMSE of 0.9 cm is found at MMX1 station deployed within the lacustrine unit, and 0.6 cm at TNGF station onto hard volcanic rocks. The sharpest subsidence gradients and angular distortions β in 2017–2019 (up to over 1/400, i.e. 0.14°) – thus the greatest vulnerability to surface faulting and cracking as a consequence of large tensile stress in the soil caused by differential settlement – are found at the foothills of Sierra de Santa Catarina, Peñón del Marqués, Cerro Chimalhuachi, Peñón de los Baños and Sierra de Chichinautzin, where the transition unit is narrower (or absent). Faults and cracks develop where β > 1/3000, i.e. 0.03%, in 2017–2019. The observed width of the influence zone (i.e. damage band), where β is still significant to induce damage, is 250 m. Differential settlement and surface faulting could compromise the serviceability of housing and utility infrastructure. It is estimated that over 457,000 properties and 1.5 million inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area (ZMVM) are in zones at high to very high surface faulting risk, mainly in Iztapalapa, Tláhuac, Chimalhuacán and Chalco. Increased flood exposure due to formation of topographic depressions involves over 751,000 properties and ~2.7 million inhabitants of the ZMVM, mainly in Nezahualcóyotl, Tláhuac, Venustiano Carranza, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero and Ecatepec de Morelos. These municipalities are often hit by catastrophic floods."
Atmospheric correction over coastal waters with aerosol properties constrained by multi-pixel observations,"We propose an innovative multi-pixel atmospheric correction approach (MPACA) to process high-spatial-resolution satellite measurements over coastal waters based on a revised POLYMER model. MPACA assumes the aerosol type to be uniform within a relatively small region, while the aerosol load and water properties are allowed to vary. Landsat-8 OLI images over six coastal locations with various turbidities were utilized to evaluate the performance of MPACA. The retrieved remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(λ)) by MPACA is validated with in situ matchups obtained from two sources: ship-based field campaigns and the AERONET-OC networks. It is found that, at each of OLI's four visible bands, MPACA provided accurate Rrs(λ) products over such coastal environments, with the Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) and Mean Absolute Percentage Difference (MAPD) less than 0.0006 sr−1 and 16.2%, respectively. In contrast, the Rrs(λ) values retrieved with NASA's SeaDAS (v7.5), where each pixel was treated independently, showed RMSD and MAPD as ~0.0018 sr−1 and ~38.8%, respectively. Acolite-DSF, which assumed some spatial dependency, obtained MAPD almost two times that of SeaDAS for each visible band. Further, it appears that Acolite-EXP did not perform well for this evaluation dataset, where RMSD is ~0.0062 sr−1 and MAPD is ~228.2%. These results suggest that MPACA is a promising scheme for atmospheric correction in coastal waters, especially for measurements from multi-band satellites that have a high spatial resolution along with at least two bands in the NIR or SWIR domain."
Flood mapping under vegetation using single SAR acquisitions,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables 24-hour, all-weather flood monitoring. However, accurate detection of inundated areas can be hindered by the extremely complicated electromagnetic interaction phenomena between microwave pulses, and horizontal and vertical targets. This manuscript focuses on the problem of inundation mapping in areas with emerging vegetation, where spatial and seasonal heterogeneity makes the systematic distinction between dry and flooded backscatter response even more difficult. In this context, image interpretation algorithms have mostly used detailed field data and reference image(s) to implement electromagnetic models or change detection techniques. However, field data are rare, and despite the increasing availability of SAR acquisitions, adequate reference image(s) might not be readily available, especially for fine resolution acquisitions. To by-pass this problem, this study presents an algorithm for automatic flood mapping in areas with emerging vegetation when only single SAR acquisitions and common ancillary data are available. First, probability binning is used for statistical analysis of the backscatter response of wet and dry vegetation for different land cover types. This analysis is then complemented with information on land use, morphology and context within a fuzzy logic approach. The algorithm was applied to three fine resolution images (one ALOS-PALSAR and two COSMO-SkyMed) acquired during the January 2011 flood in the Condamine-Balonne catchment (Australia). Flood extent layers derived from optical images were used as validation data, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm had an overall accuracy higher than 80% for all case studies. Notwithstanding the difficulty to fully discriminate between dry and flooded vegetation backscatter heterogeneity using a single SAR image, this paper provides an automatic, data parsimonious algorithm for the detection of floods under vegetation."
An automatic classification algorithm for submerged aquatic vegetation in shallow lakes using Landsat imagery,"Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is one of the main producers in inland lakes. Tracking the temporal and spatial changes in SAV is crucial for the identification of state changes in lacustrine ecosystems, such as changes in light, nutrients, and temperature. However, the available SAV classification algorithms based on remote sensing are highly dependent on field survey data and/or human interventions, prohibiting the extraction of large-scale and/or long-term patterns. Here, we developed an automatic SAV classification algorithm using Landsat imagery, where the thresholds of two key parameters (the floating algae index (FAI) and reflectance in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band) are automatically determined. The algorithm was applied to eight Landsat images of four Yangtze Plain lakes and obtained a mean producer accuracy of 82.9% when gauged against field-surveyed datasets. The algorithm was further employed to obtain long-term SAV areal data from Changdang Lake on the Yangtze Plain from 1984 to 2018, and the result was highly consistent with lake transparency data. Numerical simulations indicated that our developed algorithm is insensitive to the Chl-a concentration of the water column. Yet, it has a detection limit of ~0.35 m below the water surface, and such a limit changes with different fractions of vegetation coverage within a pixel. The automatic classification algorithm proposed in this study has the potential to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of SAV in other shallow lakes where SAV grows in lakes sharing similar hydrological characteristics as the lakes in the Yangtze Plain."
Change detection using deep learning approach with object-based image analysis,"In their applications, both deep learning techniques and object-based image analysis (OBIA) have shown better performance separately than conventional methods on change detection tasks. However, efforts to investigate the effect of combining these two techniques for advancing change detection techniques are unexplored in current literature. This study proposes a novel change detection method implementing change feature extraction using convolutional neural networks under an OBIA framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare the proposed method against benchmark pixel-based counterparts on aerial images for the task of multi-class change detection. To thoroughly assess the performance of our proposed method, this study also for the first time compared three common feature fusion schemes for change detection architecture: concatenation, differencing, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed method was also tested on simulated misregistered images to evaluate its robustness, a factor that plays an important role in compromising change detection accuracy but has not been investigated for supervised change detection methods in the literature. Finally, the proposed change detection method was also tested using very high resolution (VHR) satellite images for binary class change detection to map an impacted area caused by natural disaster and the result was evaluated using reference data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). With the experimental results from these two sets of experiments, we showed that (1) our proposed method achieved substantially higher accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to pixel-based methods, (2) three feature fusion schemes did not show a significant difference for overall accuracy, (3) our proposed method was robust in image misregistration in both testing and training data, (4) we demonstrate the potential impact of automation to decision making by deploying our method to map a large geographic area affected by a recent natural disaster.

Quantifying uncertainties in nighttime light retrievals from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Day/Night Band data,"Satellite observations of nighttime lights (NTL) from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Day/Night Band data have been widely used to estimate human activities. Long-term changes such as urban development and abrupt short-term changes such as power outages have been monitored from temporal NTL acquired by satellites. While high temporal NTL variation has been found across NTL data of varying temporal scale (e.g., daily, monthly, and annual composites), the sources of measurement error and uncertainty are poorly understood. This paper quantifies the sources of VIIRS-derived NTL uncertainty due to view-illumination geometry, surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo, and the effects of snow cover, lunar irradiance, aerosol loading, cloud mask, vegetation, geometry, and ephemeral artifacts (e.g., the Aurora Borealis). Based on this current assessment of NASA Black Marble retrievals (VNP46, Collection V001), we found that angular and atmospheric effects dominate retrieval uncertainty. Errors introduced by upstream data inputs (e.g., a coarser nighttime snow cover flag and misclassification errors in the existing VIIRS nighttime cloud mask) were also found to impact retrieval quality. Despite these challenges, a consistent daily NTL time series record can be routinely generated from top-of-atmosphere VNP46 radiances. Key recommendations include: (1) the use of lunar-BRDF adjusted and atmospherically corrected NTL (i.e., as identified as high-quality retrievals in the VNP46 QA fields), (2) development and improvement to the VIIRS snow cover and cloud masks algorithms to accurately reflect NTL retrieval conditions, (3) characterizing seasonal variations in NTL due to vegetation and snow, (4) reducing geometric effects due to the spatial mismatch of gridded pixel and observation footprint, (5) employing angularly-consistent NTL observations from multiple VIIRS instruments (i.e., Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20) to reduce pixel-based uncertainties and address persistent data gaps, and (6) being mindful of surface-reflected radiance from aurora events at mid-to-high latitudes."
LandTrendr smoothed spectral profiles enhance woody encroachment monitoring,"Secondary succession (SS) is one of the main consequences of the abandonment of agricultural and forestry practices in rural areas, causing -among other processes- woody encroachment on former pastures and croplands. In this study we model and monitor the spatial evolution of SS over semi-natural grassland communities in the mountain range of the Pyrenees in Spain, during the last 36 years (1984-2019). Independent variables for ‘annual-based’ and ‘period-based’ modeling were drawn from a suite of Surface Reflectance Landsat images, LandTrendr (LT)-algorithm-adjusted images and LT outputs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained and tested using all possible variable combinations of all the aforementioned datasets. The best modeling strategy involved yearly time series of LT-adjusted Tasseled Cap Brightness (TCB) and Wetness (TCW) axes as predictors, attaining a F1-score of 0.85, a Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.67 and an AUC 0.83. Woodlands encroached above 480,000 ha of grasslands and crops during the study period. A model using LT outputs for the whole period also denoted good performance (F1-score = 0.85, MCC = 0.75) and estimated a similar area of woodland expansion (~509,000 ha), but this ‘period’ approach was unable to provide temporal information on the year or the encroachment dynamics. Our results suggest an overall proportion of 66% for the Pyrenees being affected by SS, with higher intensity in the west-central part, decreasing towards the eastern end."

Abstract
Currently, climate change poses a global threat, which may compromise the sustainability of agriculture, forestry and other land surface systems. In a changing world scenario, the economic importance of Remote Sensing (RS) to monitor forests and agricultural resources is imperative to the development of agroforestry systems. Traditional RS technologies encompass satellite and manned aircraft platforms. These platforms are continuously improving in terms of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The high spatial and temporal resolutions, flexibility and lower operational costs make Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) a good alternative to traditional RS platforms. In the management process of forests resources, UAVs are one of the most suitable options to consider, mainly due to: (1) low operational costs and high-intensity data collection; (2) its capacity to host a wide range of sensors that could be adapted to be task-oriented; (3) its ability to plan data acquisition campaigns, avoiding inadequate weather conditions and providing data availability on-demand; and (4) the possibility to be used in real-time operations. This review aims to present the most significant UAV applications in forestry, identifying the appropriate sensors to be used in each situation as well as the data processing techniques commonly implemented."
Characterizing land cover/land use from multiple years of Landsat and MODIS time series: A novel approach using land surface phenology modeling and …,"Over the last 20 years, substantial amounts of grassland have been converted to other land uses in the Northern Great Plains. Most of land cover/land use (LCLU) assessments in this region have been based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Cropland Data Layer (USDA - CDL), which may be inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate an approach to map land cover utilizing multi-temporal Earth Observation data from Landsat and MODIS. We first built an annual time series of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from MODIS 8-day composites of land surface temperatures. Using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat Collection 1's surface reflectance, we then fit at each pixel a downward convex quadratic model to each year's progression of AGDD (i.e., EVI = α + β × AGDD − γ × AGDD2). Phenological metrics derived from fitted model and the goodness of fit then are submitted to a random forest classifier (RFC) to characterize LCLU for four sample counties in South Dakota in three years (2006, 2012, 2014) when reference point datasets are available for training and validation. To examine the sensitivity of the RFC to sample size and design, we performed classifications under different sample selection scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method accurately mapped major crops in the study area but showed limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. Although all RFC models exhibit high accuracy, estimated land cover areas from alternative models could vary widely, suggesting the need for a careful examination of model stability in any future land cover supervised classification study. Among all sampling designs, the “same distribution” models (proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population) tend to yield best land cover prediction. RFC used only the most eight important variables (e.g., three fitted parameter coefficients [α, β, and γ]; maximum modeled EVI; AGDD at maximum modeled EVI; the number of observations used to fit CxQ model; and the number of valid observations) have slightly higher accuracy compared to those using all variables. By summarizing annual image time series through land surface phenology modeling, LCLU classification can embrace both seasonality and interannual variability, thereby increasing the accuracy of LCLU change detection."
OCO-3 early mission operations and initial (vEarly) XCO2 and SIF retrievals,"NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was installed on the International Space Station (ISS) on 10 May 2019. OCO-3 combines the flight spare spectrometer from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission, which has been in operation since 2014, with a new Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA) that facilitates observations of non-nadir targets from the nadir-oriented ISS platform. The PMA is a new feature of OCO-3, which is being used to collect data in all science modes, including nadir (ND), sun-glint (GL), target (TG), and the new snapshot area mapping (SAM) mode.

This work provides an initial assessment of the OCO-3 instrument and algorithm performance, highlighting results from the first 8 months of operations spanning August 2019 through March 2020. During the In-Orbit Checkout (IOC) phase, critical systems such as power and cooling were verified, after which the OCO-3 spectrometer and PMA were subjected to a series of rigorous tests. First light of the OCO-3 spectrometer was on 26 June 2019, with full science operations beginning on 6 August 2019. The OCO-3 spectrometer on-orbit performance is consistent with that seen during preflight testing. Signal to noise ratios are in the expected range needed for high quality retrievals of the column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which will be used to help quantify and constrain the global carbon cycle.

The first public release of OCO-3 Level 2 (L2) data products, called “vEarly”, is being distributed by NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). The intent of the vEarly product is to evaluate early mission performance, facilitate comparisons with OCO-2 products, and identify key areas to improve for the next data release. The vEarly XCO2 exhibits a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of ≃ 1, 1, 2 ppm versus a truth proxy for nadir-land, TG&SAM, and glint-water observations, respectively. The vEarly SIF shows a correlation with OCO-2 measurements of >0.9 for highly coincident soundings. Overall, the Level 2 SIF and XCO2 products look very promising, with performance comparable to OCO-2. A follow-on version of the OCO-3 L2 product containing a number of refinements, e.g., instrument calibration, pointing accuracy, and retrieval algorithm tuning, is anticipated by early in 2021.

High-resolution retrieval of cloud microphysical properties and surface solar radiation using Himawari-8/AHI next-generation geostationary satellite,"Optical properties of clouds and heavy aerosol retrieved from satellite measurements are the most important elements for calculating surface solar radiation (SSR). The Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) satellite measurements receive high spatial, temporal and spectral signals, which provides an opportunity to estimate cloud, aerosol and SSR accurately.

In this study, we developed the AHI official cloud property product (version 1.0) for JAXA P-Tree system. A look-up table (LUT) method was used to calculate high-temporal (10 min) and high-spatial (5 km) SSR from AHI cloud properties. First, the LUT of the SSR estimation was optimized through a radiative transfer model to account for solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness (COT), effective particle radius (CER), aerosol optical thickness and surface albedo. Following this, COT and CER were retrieved from the AHI data, with ice cloud parameters being retrieved from an extended Voronoi ice crystal scattering database and water cloud parameters being retrieved from the Mie–Lorenz scattering model. The retrieved COT and CER for water clouds were compared well with MODIS collection 6 cloud property products, with correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. The COT of ice cloud also shows good consistency, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85. Finally, the SSR was calculated based on the SSR LUT and the retrieved cloud optical parameters. The estimated SSR was validated at 122 radiation stations from several observing networks covering the disk region of Himawari-8. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) at CMA (China Meteorological Administration) stations was 101.86 Wm−2 for hourly SSR and 31.42 Wm−2 for daily SSR; RMSE at non-CMA stations was 119.07 Wm−2 for instantaneous SSR, 81.10 Wm−2 for hourly SSR and 26.58 Wm−2 for daily SSR. Compared with the SSR estimated from conventional geostationary satellites, the accuracy of the SSR obtained in this study was significantly improved.

An advanced change detection method for time-series soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1,"The feasibility of soil moisture retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1 data has been
21 widely acknowledged, with pre-operational 1-km products currently available at regional
22 and/or continental scale using the long-term (LTCD) or short-term change detection (STCD)
23 methods. Both algorithms share the same assumptions of time-invariant roughness and
24 vegetation, which can be questionable even for a short period of 4 Sentinel-1 acquisitions (18
25 – 36 days). An advanced change detection (ACD) method is proposed in this study for an
26 improved soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 data, including two main modifications with
27 respect to the existing STCD methods: i) approximating the effect of temporal varying
28 vegetation on the Sentinel-1 backscatter as a variation in the two-way attenuation, and ii) a
29 temporal soil moisture constraint based on the coarse Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
30 soil moisture product to partly remove the uncertainty caused by vegetation and/or roughness
31 changes. The evaluation, based on time-series observations from 34 OzNet stations and ground
32 samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5)
33 showed that the ACD improved the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE)
and un biased RMSE (ubRMSE), achieving 0.66, 0.071 m3
/m3
and 0.071 m3
/m3 34 at the point
scale, 0.77, 0.063 m3

at 1-km scale, 0.80 , 0.055 m3
/m3
and 0.050 m3
/m3 35
36 at 3-km scale. The contribution of the two modifications was further investigated using 559
37 stations from 22 networks across the world, showing that: i) the two modifications can increase
R by 0.08 - 0.13 and reduce the retrieval RMSE by 0.009 - 0.013 m3
/m3 38 (10% - 15% relative),
39 and ii) the retrieval over densely vegetated areas or areas with large temporal vegetation
40 variation can benefit more from the proposed modifications. The ACD achieved stable
41 performance for various Sentinel-1 orbits/passes and maintained a stable performance for
42 retrieval windows up to 30 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, providing a promising alternative for
43 achieving consistent soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel-1."
Robust Landsat-based crop time series modelling,"Reliable satellite monitoring of agriculture is often difficult because surface variations occur rapidly compared to the cloud-free satellite observation frequency. Harmonic time series models, i.e., superimposed sequences of sines and cosines, have an established provenance for fitting satellite vegetation index time series to coarse resolution satellite data, but their application to medium resolution Landsat data for crop monitoring has been limited. Non-linear harmonic models have been shown to perform well over agricultural sites using single-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series, but have not been explored with Landsat data. The 2017 availability of Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over the United States provides the opportunity to investigate the utility of temporally rich Landsat data for 30 m pixel-level crop monitoring. In this paper, the capability of 5- and 7-parameter linear harmonic models and a 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model applied to a year of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) ARD is investigated. The analysis is undertaken over six sites, each defined by a 5000 × 5000 30 m pixel ARD tile, that together include the major conterminous United States (CONUS) crops identified by inspection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The model fits are evaluated as the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the fitted and the observed Landsat data. Considering locations with at least 21 annual Landsat observations, the 7-parameter linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.052 to 0.072) and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.054 to 0.074) are shown to be able to fit annual Landsat NDVI time series for most CONUS crops, whereas the 5-parameter linear harmonic model cannot (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.072 to 0.099). If there are between 15 and 20 annual Landsat observations, the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model is recommended for fitting annual NDVI crop time series, and if there are ≥21 observations, then either the 5-parameter non-linear or the 7-parameter linear model can be used. The 7-parameter model had marginally smaller mean NDVI RMSD values but larger standard deviations than the 5-parameter non-linear model, likely due to the relative robustness of the non-linear model to over-fitting and oscillations. None of the models could reliably fit crops with multiple stages, such as alfalfa, that are insufficiently sampled using combined Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ time series. Given the utility of the growing season peak NDVI for crop yield applications, the date and magnitude of the model fitted peak NDVI are compared to quantify model reporting differences. The differences between the 7-parameter linear and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic models are not large. For each ARD tile, the mean absolute differences in the estimated peak NDVI days varied from <2 days in the northern ARD tiles, which had short growing seasons and similar crops, to less than a week for the other tiles except for nearly 10 days for the California tile that had longer growing seasons and more diverse crops including crops with multiple stages. The paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research."
Satellite-observed shifts in C3/C4 abundance in Australian grasslands are associated with rainfall patterns,"Species composition is a key determinant of grassland ecosystem function and resilience. Climate change is predicted to alter the distribution of cool season (C3) and warm season (C4) grasses, however, the lack of spatial distributions and temporal variations of grass functional type information severely limits our understanding of climate impacts on grasslands. This study classified C3 and C4 grasses per pixel according to the peak of growing season generated from Enhanced Vegetation Index time series. From 2003 to 2017, the C3-C4 composition of Australian rain-fed grasslands and pastures was mapped at 500 m resolution on an annual basis across a wide geographical range (10°S – 45°S), and revealed extreme inter-annual fluctuations. Over the 15-year period, the satellite-derived ratio of C4 to C3 grasses significantly increased (p < 0.05), indicating a long-term shift in community composition that was confirmed with 182,911 Atlas of Living Australia ground observations. The most pronounced changes occurred in mid-latitude transitional areas where C3 and C4 grasses co-dominate. Our climate analysis indicated the inter-annual fluctuations of C4/C3 grass ratios were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with warm/cool season rainfall ratios, and not with temperature or annual rainfall. This suggests that an increase in the warm/cool season rainfall ratio favors C4 grasses and a decrease in the warm/cool season rainfall ratio favors C3 grasses. Our findings reveal spatially-detailed dynamics of grasslands and demonstrate large-scale grassland compositional changes over 15 years. The grass composition maps should help improve ecological forecasting of grass distributions and enable researches on grassland ecosystem responses to climate change that are relevant to both adaptation of rangeland agricultural and fire management practices. Our study should also help predict grass distribution under future climate conditions, and assist in the accurate modelling of global water, carbon, and energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere."
"Characterizing and correcting phase biases in short-term, multilooked interferograms","Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is widely used to measure deformation of the Earth's surface over large areas and long time periods. A common strategy to overcome coherence loss in long-term interferograms is to use multiple multilooked shorter interferograms, which can cover the same time period but maintain coherence. However, it has recently been shown that using this strategy can introduce a bias (also referred to as a “fading signal”) in the interferometric phase. We isolate the signature of the phase bias by constructing “daisy chain” sums of short-term interferograms of different length covering identical 1-year time intervals. This shows that the shorter interferograms are more affected by this phenomenon and the degree of the effect depends on ground cover types; cropland and forested pixels have significantly larger bias than urban pixels and the bias for cropland mimics subsidence throughout the year, whereas forests mimics subsidence in the spring and heave in the autumn. We, propose a method for correcting the phase bias, based on the assumption, borne out by our observations, that the bias in an interferogram is linearly related to the sum of the bias in shorter interferograms spanning the same time. We tested the algorithm over a study area in western Turkey by comparing average velocities against results from a phase linking approach, which estimates the single primary phases from all the interferometric pairs, and has been shown to be almost insensitive to the phase bias. Our corrected velocities agree well with those from a phase linking approach. Our approach can be applied to global compilations of short-term interferograms and provides accurate long-term velocity estimation without a requirement for coherence in long-term interferograms.

Local climate zone mapping as remote sensing scene classification using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China,"China, with the world’s largest population, has gone through rapid development in the last forty years and now has over 800
million urban citizens. Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other
issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research,
provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by context of the urban environment; the
minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400-1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most
existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information.
In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental
context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2
multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of
residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of
88.61% by using a large image (48×48 corresponding to 480×480 m
2
) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using
a small image representation (10×10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes
from 32×32 to 64×64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger
inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment
context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer
of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be
applied in this application."
"Evaluation of ASTER GDEM2, SRTMv3. 0, ALOS AW3D30 and TanDEM-X DEMs for the Peruvian Andes against highly accurate GNSS ground control points and …","We present an analysis for Peru of the vertical accuracy and derived geomorphological parameters of three, freely available Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with 30-m grid sizes and one commercially available 12-m DEM: ASTER GDEM2, SRTMv3.0 (hereafter called SRTM3), ALOS World 3D (AW3D30) and 12-m TanDEM-X. Their elevation values were compared against values measured with a dual-frequency Trimble 5800 Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver with two antennas in static relative positioning. A total of 139 ground control points (GCPs) with elevations of up to 4334 m above sea level (asl). were obtained from four topographically contrasting regions along the flat, arid coast, the semi-dry Andes and the Amazon rainforest. The combined results of the four areas showed that the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.907 m, SRTM3 5.113 m and AW3D30 6.246 m. For the two areas where TanDEM-X was investigated, a RMSE of 1.666 m was obtained. When considering each area individually, of the three 30-m DEMs, SRTM3 performed best in all areas, while ASTER GDEM2 was always performing worst. The standard deviation (SD) of the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 varied much more between the four study areas than the SD of SRTM3 and TanDEM-X. It was possible to establish linear correlations with R2 > 0.95 between the GNSS-measured and DEM-derived elevation values for all areas and all DEMs, which can be used to correct ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 for Peru. No relationship was found between absolute elevation and residuals. Slope angle of >15°, however, correlated to much higher residuals for SRTM3 and AW3D30, whereas a constant increase in residual correlated to a constant increase in slope angle for TanDEM-X. In general, the highest residuals corresponded to the highest slope classes. A comparison of absolute elevation values and slope angles of selected areas between ASTER GDEM2 and SRTM3, as well as between AW3D30 and SRTM3, showed in all cases more deviation from true values in areas with steeper slopes. This effect seems independent of vegetation. The presence of buildings however, severely affected performance of ASTER GDEM2. For some areas, AW3D30 suffered from mismatch between adjacent scenes and horizontal and oblique stripping. An analysis of drainage networks showed that all three 30-m DEMs were capable of producing a similar number of Strahler orders, total number of channels, minimum and maximum channel length and accumulative channel length. All DEMs produced accurate networks in the upper reaches of the catchments, but suffered in flat areas such as wide fluvial valleys and sink-filled areas. ASTER GDEM2 in particular produced parallel river channels and unnatural short cuts. Our results agreed well with those of other studies elsewhere around the world and showed that i) the vertical error is much less than those officially reported for all DEMs; ii) slope is the most determinant factor in DEM accuracy. We conclude that SRTM3 delivers the most stable performance in almost all tests and is therefore the DEM of choice for landscape analysis in Peru. TanDEM-X 12 m performed very well in our elevation accuracy test and could become a worthy successor to SRTM3."
Statistical evaluation of satellite ocean color data retrievals,"We develop a statistical approach to evaluate the performance of the ocean color data processing system for satellite-derived ocean color data products based on temporal stability of retrievals. We use the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system to obtain the normalized water-leaving reflectance ρwN(λ) spectra from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements. The deviations of ρwN(λ) spectra from temporally and spatially averaged values are investigated, and the statistics with respect to various retrieval parameters are collected, including the solar-sensor geometry (solar-zenith, sensor-zenith, and relative azimuth angles), and various ancillary data (surface wind speed, surface atmospheric pressure, water vapor amount, and ozone concentration). The performance of MSL12 is also evaluated with respect to other intermediate retrieval parameters. The study shows that MSL12 produces statistically consistent VIIRS ocean color retrievals in the global open ocean, with respect to retrieval geometry parameters, as well as the ancillary inputs."
Modelling groundwater rebound in recently abandoned coalfields using DInSAR,"Advances in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) processing
17 algorithms, such as the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS), and increased data
18 availability from SAR systems, such as Sentinel‐1, provide the opportunity to increase the
19 spatial and temporal density of ground deformation measurements. Such measurements,
2
20 when combined with modelling, have the potential to make a significant cost‐effective
21 contribution to the progressive abandonment strategy of recently closed coalfields.
22 Applications of DInSAR over coalfields have observed heave in coal measures rocks and
23 temporal correlations between the rise of mine water and deformation time‐series. The
24 cessation of systematic dewatering can have a variety of detrimental impacts and knowledge
25 of the time‐scales (i.e. the rate of rebound) and structure of the mine system are crucial to the
26 remediation strategy. Although mine plans and borehole measurements provide vital
27 information in this regard, mine plans are often incomplete or inaccurate, whereas
28 monitoring boreholes are spatially sparse. Consequently, groundwater can flow in
29 unanticipated directions via goaf, mine shafts and roadways, making it difficult to
30 determine where the impacts of rebound are likely to occur. In this study, ground
31 deformation data obtained using ISBAS DInSAR on ENVISAT (2002 – 2009) and Sentinel‐1
32 (2015 – 2019) data are used to develop a simple method to model groundwater rebound in
33 abandoned coalfields. A forward analytical model based upon the principle of effective
34 stress and mine water ponds is first implemented to estimate surface heave in response to
35 changes in groundwater levels measured in monitoring boreholes. The forward model is
36 then calibrated and validated using the ground deformation data. The DInSAR data were
37 subsequently inverted to map the change in groundwater levels in greater detail across the
38 coalfield and forecast surface discharges in order to support mitigation strategies.  "
Deep learning-based change detection in remote sensing images: A review,"Images gathered from different satellites are vastly available these days due to the fast development of remote sensing (RS) technology. These images significantly enhance the data sources of change detection (CD). CD is a technique of recognizing the dissimilarities in the images acquired at distinct intervals and are used for numerous applications, such as urban area development, disaster management, land cover object identification, etc. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have been used tremendously in change detection processes, where it has achieved great success because of their practical applications. Some researchers have even claimed that DL approaches outperform traditional approaches and enhance change detection accuracy. Therefore, this review focuses on deep learning techniques, such as supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised for different change detection datasets, such as SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, VHR, and heterogeneous images, and their advantages and disadvantages will be highlighted. In the end, some significant challenges are discussed to understand the context of improvements in change detection datasets and deep learning models. Overall, this review will be beneficial for the future development of CD methods."
Two-phase forest inventory using very-high-resolution laser scanning,"In this study, we compared a two-phase laser-scanning-based forest inventory of stands versus a traditional field inventory using sample plots. The two approaches were used to estimate stem volume (VOL), Lorey's mean height (HL), Lorey's stem diameter (DL), and VOL per tree species in a study area in Sweden. The estimates were compared at the stand level with the harvested reference values obtained using a forest harvester. In the first phase, a helicopter acquired airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with >500 points/m2 along 50-m wide strips across the stands. These strips intersected systematic plots in phase two, where terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to model DL for individual trees. In total, phase two included 99 plots across 10 boreal forest stands in Sweden (lat 62.9° N, long 16.9° E). The single trees were segmented in both the ALS and TLS data and linked to each other. The very-high-resolution ALS data enabled us to directly measure tree heights and also classify tree species using a convolutional neural network. Stem volume was predicted from the predicted DBH and the estimated height, using national models, and aggregated at the stand level. The study demonstrates a workflow to derive forest variables and stand-level statistics that has potential to replace many manual field inventories thanks to its time efficiency and improved accuracy. To evaluate the inventories, we estimated bias, RMSE, and precision, expressed as standard error. The laser-scanning-based inventory provided estimates with an accuracy considerably higher than the field inventory. The RMSE was 17 m3/ha (7.24%), 0.9 m (5.63%), and 16 mm (5.99%) for VOL, HL, and DL respectively. The tree species classification was generally successful and improved the three species-specific VOL estimates by 9% to 74%, compared to field estimates. In conclusion, the demonstrated laser-scanning-based inventory shows potential to replace some future forest inventories, thanks to the increased accuracy demonstrated empirically in the Swedish forest study area."
A novel approach for quantifying high-frequency urban land cover changes at the block level with scarce clear-sky Landsat observations,"High-frequency and complex transitions are two important characteristics of urban land cover changes (ULCCs). However, the change magnitude and duration of ULCCs have rarely been discussed in the context of high-frequency ULCCs. Moreover, previous models for quantifying high-frequency changes commonly required numerous clear-sky observations. Such requirement is difficult to be satisfied in widespread cloud-prone cities. Considering these characteristics of ULCCs and data availability, we developed a novel approach that can comprehensively quantify ULCCs with relatively limited data. The approach successfully integrated two commonly used approaches in change detection, namely temporal segmentation and trajectory classification. In addition, sparse clear-sky observations were used in the time series of fractional land cover (TSFLC). Specifically, we first conducted classifications for each year, and then extracted the TSFLC from each block. Second, we used temporal segmentation to segment the TSFLC based on the local change trend. Third, we classified the segments of time series by trajectory classification, and recorded the change information. The proposed approach can provide comprehensive details for ULCCs including the frequency of changes during the observation time, the transition, the change time, and the change magnitude for each change. The approach quantifies multiple changes with a slightly higher accuracy (93.33%) than that of previous approaches for only one change (91.00%). The categories/ transitions of ULCC were also quantified, with an accuracy of 81.67%. Moreover, the approach effectively monitored ULCCs in a cloud-prone city and successfully captured and analyzed two common transitions, block construction and urban renewal. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing complete and accurate ULCC information with scarce clear-sky observations."
Evaluating the capacity of single photon lidar for terrain characterization under a range of forest conditions,"Accurate digital elevation models are key data products used to inform forest management. Light detection and ranging (lidar) technologies have emerged as a useful tool for acquiring detailed terrain information, although the accuracy of this data is known to vary with topographic complexity and the density and characteristics of overlying vegetation. Single Photon Lidar (SPL) provides a high-density point cloud that can be acquired from a much higher altitude than discrete return, small-footprint lidar (hereafter, linear-mode lidar or LML), providing efficiencies and potential cost savings for operational mapping programs. Herein, we assess the absolute and relative accuracies of leaf-on and leaf-off SPL data acquired at different altitudes for characterizing terrain under varying vegetation types and densities and compare to results for LML data. Our assessment was forest-focused and primarily point based, using 299 Real-Time Kinematic survey checkpoints to quantify elevation errors (Δh); however, we also investigated and reported accuracy for linear transects, and conducted a wall-to-wall comparison of the SPL-derived 1-m digital elevation models (DEMs) against an LML-derived DEM. Point cloud characteristics for the leaf-on 2018 SPL data were markedly different, with 88% of returns as first returns, compared to 17% for the LML, and 59% and 46% for the leaf-off SPL data acquired at 3800 m and 2000 m, respectively. Of the datasets considered herein, the SPL data acquired under leaf-on conditions in 2018 had the lowest accuracy and precision for characterizing terrain underneath vegetation cover, with an RMSE of 10.97 cm and a 95th quantile of 24.03 cm; however these values are within commonly accepted error limits for elevation products. The leaf-off SPL data were most accurate overall; however, the differences between the leaf-off SPL data acquired at 3800 m versus 2000 m were often minor (< 1 cm on average), with similar patterns in Δh between the two datasets (r = 0.8). In terms of the relative performance of the lidar datasets examined, results from the analyses of linear transects were similar to those of the checkpoints, but highlighted the variability in elevation accuracy within similar cover types. Wall-to-wall comparisons of the SPL-derived DEMs to the 2012 LML DEM also corroborated the results of the checkpoint assessment, with the 2018 SPL leaf-on DEM having the largest differences (mean difference = 7.44 cm; RMSD = 18.07 cm). Differences between DEMs did not trend consistently with increasing canopy cover or with the percentage of returns that were within ±15 cm of the ground surface. We found that it was not only the density of the vegetation, but also the composition and configuration of both the overstory and understory vegetation that influenced the accuracy with which the lidar characterized the terrain surface. Overall, our results indicated that leaf-on SPL is capable of capturing terrain information under a wide variety of forest and vegetation conditions, albeit at a lower accuracy than what is possible with leaf-on LML or leaf-off SPL, but at a level of accuracy that is within acceptable limits for most forest applications."
Retrieving bbp and POC from CALIOP: A deep neural network approach,"The CALIOP instrument has demonstrated tremendous potential in terms of oceanic detection. Nighttime measurements from spaceborne lidar increase knowledge of the diurnal variability of ocean optical properties, while measurements in polar regions fill the gaps that passive measurements of ocean color may leave in these areas. However, due to non-ideal instrumental characteristics, errors may occur during retrieval of the ocean optical properties that are derived directly from CALIOP's measured signals. These errors are caused by the transient response (TR) function of the detectors and the polarization crosstalk (CT) between the polarization beam splitters. However, there is no study that integrates and explicitly describes both the required corrections. In addition, the published physics-based methods for retrieving the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp) from CALIOP use an empirical linear relationship between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180° b(π) without considering the spatial and temporal variability associated with the conversion coefficient. In this study, after both effects are eliminated through TR deconvolution and CT correction, an innovative deep neural network (DNN) approach is proposed to retrieve bbp and particulate organic carbon (POC) from CALIOP. The DNN is trained with the CALIOP total ocean column-integrated depolarization ratio and subsurface column-integrated perpendicular backscatter data, which are combined with the collocated daytime MODIS bbp and POC products. Once the DNN has been trained with the daytime MODIS product, measurements can be derived from CALIOP in conditions not covered by MODIS data, such as at night or in polar regions. Compared to published physics-based methods, this approach does not require diffuse attenuation coefficients, nor are additional assumptions regarding the conversion coefficient between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180° b(π) necessary. A comparison of global total depolarization ratios, which are calculated before and after TR deconvolution and CT correction, indicates the necessity and efficacy of correction, and the preliminary results show that the oceanic properties derived from CALIOP via this DNN-based approach agree better with the MODIS products than those derived with the traditional physics-based methods. The use of lidar measurements to derive bbp and POC without relying on passively acquired data is of great interest to the ocean color community."
Integrating remote sensing and machine learning into environmental monitoring and assessment of land use change,"Addressing the increasing burden on land use requires effective policy for sustainable land use along with economic development. Analysis of local and global indicators based on land use maps could reveal information on the progress of sustainable development. This study proposes a method that reduces the time and cost of creating land use maps applicable for many purposes of environmental protection. Freely accessible existing data, Sentinel-2 satellite images, together with a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, are integrated to generate an annual map, sufficient to meet the intended needs. The method is illustrated by a case study of Phuket in Thailand. An annual map for Phuket created using the proposed method was compared to the official map released by the Thai government for the year 2018. The two maps did not differ significantly, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. Annual maps were then produced for several years to assess the effect of land use change in the past 19 years on the environmental and sustainable management in Phuket. Although there was evidence of the efforts to develop Phuket island as a sustainable province such as the government policy to conserve green areas, land use change based analytical results indicated Phuket's urban development was not going in an environmentally sustainable direction.

Terrestrial laser scanning intensity captures diurnal variation in leaf water potential,"During the past decades, extreme events have become more prevalent and last longer, and as a result drought-induced plant mortality has increased globally. Timely information on plant water dynamics is essential for understanding and anticipating drought-induced plant mortality. Leaf water potential (ΨL), which is usually measured destructively, is the most common metric that has been used for decades for measuring water stress. Remote sensing methods have been developed to obtain information on water dynamics from trees and forested landscapes. However, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the existing methods have limited our understanding of the water dynamics and diurnal variation of ΨL within single trees. Thus, we investigated the capability of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) intensity in observing diurnal variation in ΨL during a 50-h monitoring period. We aimed to improve the understanding on how large a part of the diurnal variation in ΨL can be captured using TLS intensity observations. We found that TLS intensity at the 905 nm wavelength measured from a static position was able to explain 77% of the variation in ΨL for three trees of two tree species with a root mean square error of 0.141 MPa. Based on our experiment with three trees, a time series of TLS intensity measurements can be used in detecting changes in ΨL, and thus it is worthwhile to expand the investigations to cover a wider range of tree species and forests and further increase our understanding of plant water dynamics at wider spatial and temporal scales."
Remote sensing of forest degradation: a review,"Forest degradation affects forest structure, composition and diversity, carbon stocks, functionality and ecosystem processes. It is known to contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, but there is uncertainty about the relative size of these emissions. This is largely because while deforestation, or long-term forest clearance, has been successfully monitored using remote sensing (RS) technology, there are more difficulties in using RS to quantify forest degradation, in which the area remains as forest, but with an altered structure, composition and function. A major challenge in estimating emissions from forest degradation is that in addition to identifying the areas affected, the amount of biomass loss over time in a given area must be estimated. Contributory challenges to mapping, monitoring and quantifying forest degradation include the complexity of the concept of degradation, limitations in the spatial and temporal resolution of RS sensors, and the inherent complexity of detecting degradation caused by different disturbance processes and forest uses. We take the innovative approach of dividing the studies reviewed by the specific type of forest disturbance that is being monitored (selective logging, fires, shifting cultivation and fuelwood extraction etc.), since these different activities will result in different signatures in the canopy and thus may determine the type of RS technology that may best be applied."
Assessment of approaches for monitoring forest structure dynamics using bi-temporal digital aerial photogrammetry point clouds,"Assessing changes in forest structure over time is crucial for monitoring forest resources, supporting sustainable forest management practices, and providing key insights into changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent research interest and rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) technology principally due to its low cost and timeliness, is providing high-spatial resolution data for enhancing forest inventories and forest dynamics monitoring. The increasing prevalence of these UAV acquired datasets in forestry promotes a need for better understanding of how DAP-based point clouds change over time, and how these changes may relate to changes in forest structure. In this study, we utilized bi-temporal DAP data to investigate changes in forest structure over a 3-year period in subtropical planted forest stands throughout Dongtai Yellow Sea National Forest Park, Jiangsu Province, China. To do so, we evaluated both direct (i.e., structural parameter changes estimated using the differences between bi-temporal DAP metrics) and indirect (i.e., structural parameters were modelled for each date, and their changes predicted as their differences) methods to estimate the changes in forest structure. In addition, once models were developed, changes in Lorey's mean height and volume were extrapolated across the entire study site and examined related to the forest type and age. Our assessments of the different approaches showed that the direct approach (R2 = 0.54–0.78) resulted in improved accuracy compared to the indirect method (R2 = 0.51–0.73). The distributional metrics, namely, height percentiles (e.g., H75 and H95) and canopy return density (e.g., D7 and D5), and the Weibull-fitted metrics (e.g., α) were found to be sensitive to changes in structural parameters, whereas canopy volume-related metrics had relatively low predictive capabilities. Overall, the predicted changes in Lorey's mean height and volume were mapped over the entire study area, and indicated that Lorey's mean height increased mostly in middle-aged and young forest stands. Over-mature stands showed the lowest height increment. This study proved the capability of using bi-temporal point clouds from UAV-based DAP for enhancing forest inventories and promoting sustainable forest management."
Current practices in UAS-based environmental monitoring,"With the increasing role that unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are playing in data collection for environmental studies, two key challenges relate to harmonizing and providing standardized guidance for data collection, and also establishing protocols that are applicable across a broad range of environments and conditions. In this context, a network of scientists are cooperating within the framework of the Harmonious Project to develop and promote harmonized mapping strategies and disseminate operational guidance to ensure best practice for data collection and interpretation. The culmination of these efforts is summarized in the present manuscript. Through this synthesis study, we identify the many interdependencies of each step in the collection and processing chain, and outline approaches to formalize and ensure a successful workflow and product development. Given the number of environmental conditions, constraints, and variables that could possibly be explored from UAS platforms, it is impractical to provide protocols that can be applied universally under all scenarios. However, it is possible to collate and systematically order the fragmented knowledge on UAS collection and analysis to identify the best practices that can best ensure the streamlined and rigorous development of scientific products."
Comparison of accuracy of surface temperature images from unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite for precise thermal environment monitoring of urban parks …,"Rapid urbanization has led to several severe environmental problems, including so-called heat island effects, which can be mitigated by creating more urban green spaces. However, the temperature of various surfaces differs and precise measurement and analyses are required to determine the “coolest” of these. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of surface temperature data based on thermal infrared (TIR) cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have recently been utilized for the spatial analysis of surface temperatures. Accordingly, we investigated land surface temperatures (LSTs) in green spaces, specifically those of different land cover types in an urban park in Korea. We compared and analyzed LST data generated by a thermal infrared (TIR) camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and LST data from the Landsat 8 satellite for seven specific periods. For comparison and evaluation, we measured in situ LSTs using contact thermometers. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R2 0.912, root mean square error (RMSE) 3.502 °C) than Landsat TIR LST accuracy (R2 value lower than 0.3 and RMSE of 7.246 °C) in all periods. The Landsat TIR LST did not show distinct LST characteristics by period and land cover type; however, grassland, the largest land cover type in the study area, showed the highest accuracy. With regard to the accuracy of the UAV TIR LST by season, the accuracy was higher in summer and spring (𝑅2
 0.868–0.915, RMSE 2.523–3.499 °C) than in autumn and winter (𝑅2
 0.766–0.79, RMSE 3.834–5.398 °C). Some land cover types (concrete bike path, wooden deck) were overestimated, showing relatively high total RMSEs of 4.439 °C and 3.897 °C, respectively, whereas grassland, which has lower LST, was underestimated—showing a total RMSE of 3.316 °C. Our results showed that the UAV TIR LST could be measured with sufficient reliability for each season and land cover type in an urban park with complex land cover types. Accordingly, our results could contribute to decision-making for urban spaces and environmental planning in consideration of the thermal environment."
"Monitoring the effect of urban development on urban heat island based on remote sensing and geo-spatial approach in Kolkata and adjacent areas, India","Climate change and the rapid urbanization process can trigger the current urban heat island effect. An urban heat island is categorized by temperature variation between urban and rural environments. Urban areas are mostly hotter than rural areas due to urbanization, population pressure, industrialization, vegetation insufficiency, and transportation system. Thermal remote sensing was used to carry out the exploration of urban heat islands over Kolkata municipality and surrounding urban and rural-urban fringe areas, India. This study was identify the land use/land cover change dynamics and land surface temperature analysis as well as the correlation analysis of LST, LULC, NDVI, and NDBI. Built-up areas were located 22.01% (1990), 31.44% (2000), 44.21% (2010) and 55.768% (2020). The Annual temperature was increased 0.157 °C per year. The relationship between LST and NDVI was showing a negative correlation because of the vegetated area affected due to urban expansion. The relation between LST and NDBI resulted in a positive correlation because of anthropogenic activities. The CA-ANN was used for LULC prediction of the year 2030 and 2050 for future urban expansion and environmental degradation. Those areas need proper planning for better healthy livelihood and also protect our environment otherwise climate change will affect the entire location."
UAV remote sensing applications in marine monitoring: Knowledge visualization and review,"With the booming development of information technology and the growing demand for remote sensing data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has emerged. In recent years, UAV remote sensing technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in the fields of military defense, agricultural monitoring, surveying and mapping management, and disaster and emergency response and management. Currently, increasingly serious marine biological and environmental problems are raising the need for effective and timely monitoring. Compared with traditional marine monitoring technologies, UAV remote sensing is becoming an important means for marine monitoring thanks to its flexibility, efficiency and low cost, while still producing systematic data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study visualizes the knowledge domain of the application and research advances of UAV remote sensing in marine monitoring by analyzing 1130 articles (from 1993 to early 2022) using a bibliometric approach and provides a review of the application of UAVs in marine management mapping, marine disaster and environmental monitoring, and marine wildlife monitoring. It aims to promote the extensive application of UAV remote sensing in the field of marine research.

Improved estimation of the global top-of-atmosphere albedo from AVHRR data,"The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo, a key component of the earth's energy balance, can be monitored regularly by satellite observations. Compared to the previous study Song et al. (2018), this paper estimates TOA albedo by directly linking Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) narrowband reflectance with TOA broadband albedo determined by NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instead of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The TOA albedo product developed in this study has an increased spatial resolution, from 1° to 0.05°, and its starting year has been extended from 2000 to 1981, compared to the CERES TOA albedo product. Models of lands and oceans are established separately under different atmospheric and surface conditions using gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) method instead of the linear regression models in the previous study. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the cloudy-sky, clear-sky and snow-cover models over land are 11.2%, 9.2% and 2.3%, respectively; over oceans they are 14.6%, 10.6% and 5.6%, respectively. Compared to Song et al. (2018), the improvements of the three models over land are 28.8%, 29.2% and 68.6%, respectively. Compared to the CERES product, the new product is much more accurate than that from our previous study. The global monthly mean differences of the TOA albedo obtained with the GBRT product and CERES from 2001 to 2014 are mostly less than 5%."
Machine learning and remote sensing integration for leveraging urban sustainability: A review and framework,"Climate change and rapid urbanisation exacerbated multiple urban issues threatening urban sustainability. Numerous studies integrated machine learning and remote sensing to monitor urban issues and develop mitigation strategies for sustainability. However, few studies comparatively analysed joint applications of machine learning and remote sensing for urban issues and sustainability. This paper presents a systematic review and formulates a framework integrating machine learning and remote sensing in urban studies. The literature analysis reveals: Most studies occurred in Asia, Europe, and North America, driven by technical and ethical factors, highlighting responsible approaches for data-scarce regions; Reviewed studies prioritised physical spatial aspects over socioeconomic factors, requiring multi-source data for comprehensive analysis; Conventional satellite, aerial images, and Lidar data are prevalent due to affordability, quality, and accessibility; Although supervised machine learning dominates, unsupervised methods and algorithm selection paradigms require exploration; Integration offers accurate results and thorough analysis in image processing and analytics, while image acquisition and decision-making necessitate human supervision. This paper provides a comprehensive review and an integrative framework for machine learning and remote sensing, enriching insights into their potential for urban studies and spatial analytics. The study informs urban planning and policymaking by promoting efficient management via enhanced machine learning and remote sensing integration, and bolstering data-driven decision-making."

A review of multi-class change detection for satellite remote sensing imagery,"Change Detection (CD) provides a research basis for environmental monitoring, urban expansion and reconstruction as well as disaster assessment, by identifying the changes of ground objects in different time periods. Traditional CD focused on the Binary Change Detection (BCD), focusing solely on the change and no-change regions. Due to the dynamic progress of earth observation satellite techniques, the spatial resolution of remote sensing images continues to increase, Multi-class Change Detection (MCD) which can reflect more detailed land change has become a hot research direction in the field of CD. Although many scholars have reviewed change detection at present, most of the work still focuses on BCD. This paper focuses on the recent progress in MCD, which includes five major aspects: challenges, datasets, methods, applications and future research direction. Specifically, the background of MCD is first introduced. Then, the major difficulties and challenges in MCD are discussed and delineated. The benchmark datasets for MCD are described, and the available open datasets are listed. Moreover, MCD is further divided into three categories and the specific techniques are described, respectively. Subsequently, the common applications of MCD are described. Finally, the relevant literature in the main journals of remote sensing in the past five years are analyzed and the development and future research direction of MCD are discussed. This review will help researchers understand this field and provide a reference for the subsequent development of MCD. Our collections of MCD benchmark datasets are available at:"
Environmental hazard assessment and monitoring for air pollution using machine learning and remote sensing,"The prediction and study of air pollution is a complex process due to the presence of controlling factors, different land use, and different sources for the elaboration of pollution. In this study, we applied the machine learning technique (Random Forest) with time series of particulate matter pollution records to predict and develop a particulate matter pollution susceptibility map. The applied method is to strict measures and to better manage particulate matter pollution in Ras Garib city, Egypt as a case study. Air pollution data for the period between 2018 and 2021 is collected using five air quality stations. Some of these stations are located near highly urbanized locations and could be dense with the current rates of development in the future. The random forest was applied to verify and visualize the relationships between the particulate matter and different independent variables. Spectral bands of Landsat OLI 8 imaginary and land cover/land use indices were used to prepare independent variables. Analysis of the results reveals that the proper air quality distribution monitoring stations would provide a deep insight into the pollution distribution over the study site. Distance from the roads and the land surface temperature has a significant effect on the distribution of air quality distribution. The obtained probability and classification maps were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The outcome prediction maps are reasonable and will be helpful for future air quality monitoring and improvements. Furthermore, the applied method of pollutant concentration prediction is able to improve decision-making and provide appropriate solutions."
Progress and challenges in intelligent remote sensing satellite systems,"Due to advances in remote sensing satellite imaging and image processing technologies and their wide applications, intelligent remote sensing satellites are facing an opportunity for rapid development. The key technologies, standards, and laws of intelligent remote sensing satellites are also experiencing a series of new challenges. Novel concepts and key technologies in the intelligent hyperspectral remote sensing satellite system have been proposed since 2011. The aim of these intelligent remote sensing satellites is to provide real-time, accurate, and personalized remote sensing information services. This article reviews the current developments in new-generation intelligent remote sensing satellite systems, with a focus on intelligent remote sensing satellite platforms, imaging payloads, onboard processing systems, and other key technological chains. The technological breakthroughs and current defects of intelligence-oriented designs are also analyzed. Intelligent remote sensing satellites collect personalized remote sensing data and information, with real-time data features and information interaction between remote sensing satellites or between satellites and the ground. Such developments will expand the use of remote sensing applications beyond government departments and industrial users to a massive number of individual users.

Remote sensing of indoor thermal environment from outside the building through window opening gap by using infrared camera,"Investigation of housing indoor temperature is important for understanding the comfort, health and living conditions of the local residents. The traditional method to measure indoor temperature is to place sensors at the target places, which is not only expensive but also inconvenient for indoor temperature investigation, especially for the investigation at community and city scale. In this study, a novel method was proposed to obtain the indoor temperatures remotely from outside the building through window opening area using and infrared camera. Compared with the traditional contact measurement method, the proposed remote sensing method could detect the indoor temperature without entering the room. Moreover, the infrared image could reflect the spatial distribution information of indoor temperature. To verify the feasibility and accuracy of this method, an experiment was conducted in a test room under heating, transitional, and cooling conditions with various window opening grades. It was found that the infrared images at the window opening area could reflect the spatial distribution of indoor temperature with an accuracy within 0.5 °C under stable heating and transitional conditions. In the fan coil cooling condition, however, although the infrared image can reflect the cold air flow pattern, the deviations between the infrared temperature and the measured room temperature exceeded 1.0 °C. The effect of window opening grade on the recognition accuracy kept within 0.5 °C."
"Remote sensing for monitoring tropical dryland forests: A review of current research, knowledge gaps and future directions for Southern Africa","Climate change, manifest via rising temperatures, extreme drought, and associated anthropogenic activities, has a negative impact on the health and development of tropical dryland forests. Southern Africa encompasses significant areas of dryland forests that are important to local communities but are facing rapid deforestation and are highly vulnerable to biome degradation from land uses and extreme climate events. Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies helps to assess and monitor forest ecosystems and provide spatially explicit, operational, and long-term data to assist the sustainable use of tropical environment landscapes. The period from 2010 onwards has seen the rapid development of remote sensing research on tropical forests, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This review aims to analyse and synthesise the evidence published in peer review studies with a focus on optical and radar remote sensing of dryland forests in Southern Africa from 1997–2020. For this study, 137 citation indexed research publications have been analysed with respect to publication timing, study location, spatial and temporal scale of applied remote sensing data, satellite sensors or platforms employed, research topics considered, and overall outcomes of the studies. This enabled us to provide a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, major research topics studies, EO product gaps/challenges, and to propose ways in which challenges may be overcome. It is hoped that this review will motivate discussion and encourage uptake of new remote sensing tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), data (e.g., the Sentinel satellites), improved vegetation parameters (e.g., red-edge related indices, vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and methodologies (e.g., data fusion or deep learning, etc.), where these have potential applications in monitoring dryland forests."
Mapping bottom type and water depth in shallow coastal waters with satellite remote sensing,"Species composition of benthic macroalgal cover and the changes therein are indicators of the trophic state of aquatic ecosystems. On the other hand, mapping and knowledge of water depth in shallow water areas, not accessible by hydrographical ships, is important for several reasons. This study assessed the suitability of high spatial resolution multispectral and medium spatial resolution hyperspectral data for mapping water depth and benthic macroalgal cover in shallow coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. Results of this study indicate that use of multispectral satellite data with high spatial resolution is preferable to using hyperspectral medium resolution data in mapping benthic macroalgal cover in areas where the spatial heterogeneity is very high. In case of a single image and availability of in situ data, multispectral high spatial resolution (2.4 m) satellite QuickBird can provide more detailed information about benthic cover than was assumed based on the shape of reflectance spectra of different bottom types and spectral resolution of the sensor. Depth maps of shallow (less than 3 metres) waters proved to be reliable except in turbid water areas with no bottom visibility."
"Impact of urbanization on land surface temperature and surface urban heat Island using optical remote sensing data: A case study of Jeju Island, Republic of Korea","Urbanization changes the existing form of land use and cover (LULC) which can influence the land surface temperature (LST). Therefore, it is important to present the causes of urban heat island (UHI) which is usually linked with anthropogenic activities. There are very few studies on thermal behavior of Korean cities in literature. Hence, in this study we have estimated the LULC of Jeju island and analyzed LST using Landsat (TM/ETM+/OLI) images for the last two decades. The supervised image classification method employed with maximum likelihood classifier algorithm was used to classify the images and thermal band was used to calculate the LST. We have used simplified urban extent (SUE) algorithm to calculate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and eventually we have correlated the SUHI with mean wind speed of Jeju Island. The results of LULC revealed that urban area increased from 8.69% in 2002 to 20.81% in 2021 and in this period barren land decreased by 34.88% due to urban expansion. Interestingly forest region has been slightly increased which is influenced by decreasing barren land. The accuracy was assessed using confusion matrix for the classified images and results revealed an overall accuracy of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.92 with kappa coefficient of 79.02%, 76.45% and 88.05% for the years of 2002, 2011, and 2021 respectively. The LST of all LULC classes were calculated which revealed the highest temperature for urban class which is followed by barren land. However, the forest cover and water body have the lowest temperature in the island. The intensity of surface urban heat island (SUHI) was increased from 2.47 °C (2002) to 3.10 °C (2021). We have correlated the wind speed and SUHI which revealed that SUHI and wind speed has inverse relationship. The outcome of this research can be utilized by the policymakers, urban planners, architects, and climatologist to develop policy related to climate-resilient cities.

Spatially explicit carbon emissions by remote sensing and social sensing,"Scientific simulation of carbon emissions is an important prerequisite for achieving low-carbon green development and carbon peak and carbon neutralization. This study proposed a carbon emissions spatialization method based on nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing and municipal electricity social sensing. First, the economics-energy comprehensive index (EECI) was proposed by integrating the NTL and municipal electricity consumption (EC) data. Second, the carbon emissions were spatialized at a fine scale based on NTL, EC, and EECI, respectively. Finally, the geographical detector model was applied to quantify the influencing factors on carbon emissions from the perspectives of individuals and interactions. Results show that combining remote sensing and social sensing data helps depict carbon emissions accurately. The factor analysis found that GDP and population were the basis of carbon emissions, while the secondary industry and urbanization rate were the direct factors. This study is expected to provide constructive suggestions and methods for emission reduction, carbon peak, and carbon neutrality in high-density cities in China."
Land use land cover classification of remote sensing images based on the deep learning approaches: a statistical analysis and review,"Over the last few years, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained popularity and have become the new standard for data processing in remote sensing analysis. Deep learning architectures have drawn significant attention due to their improved performance in a variety of segmentation, classification, and other machine vision applications. In remote sensing, land use and land cover (LULC) are critical components of a wide variety of environmental applications. Changes in land use on a spatial and temporal scale occur due to accuracy, the capacity to develop, flexibility, uncertainty, structure, and the capability to integrate available models. Therefore, LULC modeling’s high performance demands the employment of a wide variety of model types in remote sensing, which include dynamic, statistical, and DL models. In this study, we first analysed several key findings and research gaps in traditional technology while discussing various software applications used for LULC analysis. Second, the fundamental DL and ML concepts applicable to LULC are introduced with their merits and demerits. We employ a comprehensive review of distinct DL architectures and a custom framework to handle the challenging task of detecting changes in LULC. Subsequently, a detailed statistical analysis is conducted on the”Scopus database” to ascertain current trends in LULC utilising DL methods. This overview encompasses practically all applications and technologies in the field of LULC, from preprocessing to mapping. Finally, we conclude with a proposal for researchers to perform future potential using state-of-the-art methodologies.

Change detection in remote sensing image data comparing algebraic and machine learning methods,"Remote sensing technology has penetrated all the natural resource segments as it provides precise information in an image mode. Remote sensing satellites are currently the fastest-growing source of geographic area information. With the continuous change in the earth’s surface and the wide application of remote sensing, change detection is very useful for monitoring environmental and human needs. So, it is necessary to develop automatic change detection techniques to improve the quality and reduce the time required by manual image analysis. This work focuses on the improvement of the classification accuracy of the machine learning techniques by reviewing the training samples and comparing the post-classification comparison with the image differencing in the algebraic technique. Landsat data are medium spatial resolution data; that is why pixel-wise computation has been applied. Two change detection techniques have been studied by applying a decision tree algorithm using a separability matrix and image differencing. The first change detection, e.g., the separability matrix, is a post-classification comparison in which individual images are classified by a decision tree algorithm. The second change detection is, e.g., the image differencing change detection technique in which changed and unchanged pixels are determined by applying the corner method to calculate the threshold on the changing image. The performance of the machine learning algorithm has been validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the change detection using the post-classification method produced better results when compared to the image differencing of the algebraic change detection technique."
Detection and assessment of the spatio-temporal land use/cover change in the Thai Binh province of Vietnam's Red River delta using remote sensing and GIS,"The land is one of the prime natural resources of a country, and its transformation is a natural process that cannot be stopped but can be regulated. The issues of land use change and land cover change (LULC) have been a concern in various fields of research on management, monitoring, land planning, landslides, erosion, and global climate change for sustainable development purposes. This study aims to monitor the spatial–temporal land use pattern changes in the lowland Thai Binh province of Vietnam’s Red River Delta and its driving force factors by applying remote sensing (RS) images and GIS techniques during 2000–2020. The supervised classification technique was implemented to classify these images into six significant classes (waterbodies, forests, agriculture, aquaculture, settlements, and bare soil/rock). The Kappa coefficient to evaluate the classification accuracy obtained values greater than 0.8 for all three studied years (2000, 2010, and 2020). The results show that the agriculture class area decreased sharply from 1255.01 km2 in 2000 to 740.49 km2 in 2020. On the other hand, the settlement area increased sharply and continuously during the studied 20-year period from 207.00 km2 in 2000 to 727.07 km2 in 2020. Meanwhile, the waterbodies, forests, aquaculture, and bare soil/rock classes have minor changes. The findings demonstrate that the land use changes in the study area during the past 20 years are due to socioeconomic development, especially urbanization, which provides essential insights for land use management in future planning."
Multi-source remote sensing data shows a significant increase in vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau since 2000,"In recent years, there has been growing concern that vegetation changes on the Tibetan Plateau are associated with climate change (temperature and precipitation) and human activities. This study used six types of remote sensing vegetation data, including GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI, MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), SPOT Vegetation (Spot-VGT) NDVI, LAI (Leaf Area Index) and NPP (Net Primary Productivity), and applied the maximum synthesis method, trend analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate statistical analysis to investigate vegetation change processes since the 1980s. The study showed that the amount of vegetation on the TP had increased significantly since 2000 (p < .01), especially in the northeastern part of the TP. There was no significant change prior to 2000. The different vegetation data sources varied greatly. Four remote sensing indices, MODIS EVI, Spot-VGT NDVI, LAI, and NPP, showed a significant increase in vegetation from 2000, accounting for 16.18%, 44.55%, 30.44% and 8.94% of the total area, respectively (p < .05). Multiple data sources provided a more comprehensive understanding, whereas a single data source had substantial uncertainty. Human activities, such as the implementation of large-scale ecological projects, played a dominant role in increasing vegetation, while climate change played a subsidiary role. The MODIS EVI, Spot-VGT NDVI, LAI, and NPP data showed that the area of increased vegetation caused by human activities accounted for 53.51%, 45.68%, 37.52%, and 31.79% of the total area of the TP, respectively. The relative increase from climate change was 10.28%, 17.49%, 13.15%, and 8.82%, respectively. The current study applied multi-source remotely sensed vegetation data, which effectively reduced the uncertainty caused by individual data sources and provided more rigorous and scientific research conclusions."
"Flash flood-induced vulnerability and need assessment of wetlands using remote sensing, GIS, and econometric models","Flash flood vulnerability mapping and livelihood vulnerability assessment are often considered essential elements of risk reduction strategies and act as indispensable initiatives. In line with the contention, an effort has been made to restrict flash flood vulnerability mapping and need assessment based on vulnerability classification at haor regions in Bangladesh using satellite remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and econometric models. First, flash flood vulnerability mapping was performed using a bivariate statistical regression-based frequency ratio (FR) model. The vulnerability mapping results revealed that wetlands from land use land cover (LULC), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) (>0.65–0.94), drainage density (>0.0166–0.0219 m/m2), flooding depth (2.61–3.40 m), and rainfall (2243–2619 mm/6 months) have significant roles in flash floods occurring with selected factor weight values of 2.241, 1.935, 1.576, 1.391 and 1.032, respectively. Moreover, the outputs of vulnerability mapping were classified into very high (7.57%), high (22.56%), moderate (56.96%), low (12.34%), and very low (0.56%), covering areas of 1303.0, 3882.0, 9801.0, 2124.0 and 96.0 km2, respectively. Second, 40 sampled respondents from each vulnerable groups were interviewed to assess their vulnerability and coping strategies against flash floods using field survey data through the composite livelihood vulnerability index (CLVI). CLVI findings showed that the vulnerability differences among the five groups of respondents were relevant to vulnerability mapping and classification done in the remote sensing and GIS platform. The logit estimates explained that the age of the household head, household size, farming experience, educational status, occupation of the household head, farm size, proximity to the marketplace, and no. of earning members affect farmers' attitudes toward coping strategies at different levels significantly. Identifying the risk of a flash flood in providing farmers with accurate information, developing advanced risk management strategies, and providing agricultural credit and service provision, policymakers and research institutions may benefit from mapping and evaluating their livelihood vulnerability on a single platform.

Spatio-temporal fluctuations analysis of land surface temperature (LST) using Remote Sensing data (LANDSAT TM5/8) and multifractal technique to characterize the …,"Accurate estimation of the microenvironment and radiative susceptibility, as well as forecasting of climate and weather scenarios in urban contexts, are critical for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Rapid urbanization has a substantial impact on both the local and global atmosphere, resulting in Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). This study is the first to attempt to analyze spatiotemporal space-borne sensor datasets in the Indian Himalayan foothills using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA). The coefficients derived through MDFA such as holder exponent (h), spectral width (α), irregularity, truncation spectra, and spatial distribution are analyzed for various land features to illustrate the dynamic patterns and corroborate the multifractality behavior of the land surface temperature (LST). The negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) suggests that vegetated land can assist to mitigate the effects of UHIs, whereas the positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) suggests that urbanization can aggravate the effects of UHIs. The obtained result encourages to implementation of the suggested framework to address anthropogenic heat and the transportation of surface heat fluxes, as well as empowers to work on non-linear dynamic climate models, which are critical for building real-time resilient infrastructure to meet environmental sustainability."
Assessing the recent trends of land degradation and desertification in Romania using remote sensing indicators,"Land degradation (LD) and desertification (DS) are a sensitive global issue including southern and south-eastern Europe, which is severely affected by climate change. In this study, a state-of-the-art approach for assessing the intensity of LD and DS processes using remote-sensing-derived indicators within a GIS environment was proposed. The analysis was carried out using the Principal Component Analysis based on integrating the significant trends of relevant biophysical parameters in Romania. The methodology was tested and validated at the national level in Romania. In total, 7.76% of the area was identified as LD and 60.8% of the total area tended to improve, and 31.44% was stable. Most of the regions with LD overlapped with the dryland areas, while improvement areas were identified outside of the drylands. In forested areas from high altitudes, a tendency to improve the condition of vegetation was observed, and most of the surfaces being protected were natural areas that have benefited from proper management. All these results can be used to adapt management practices to avoid, reduce, or restore the LD. The proposed model was based on globally available remote sensing datasets, with a high frequency of data acquisition and collection history that allows for the statistical analyses of changes on a global scale."
Bathymetric mapping and estimation of water storage in a shallow lake using a remote sensing inversion method based on machine learning,"Accurate lake depth mapping and estimation of changes in water level and water storage are fundamental significance for understanding the lake water resources on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, combined with satellite images and bathymetric data, we comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of a multi-factor combined linear regression model (MLR) and machine learning models, create a depth distribution map and compare it with the spatial interpolation, and estimate the change of water level and water storage based on the inverted depth. The results indicated that the precision of the random forest (RF) was the highest with a coefficient of determination (R2) value (0.9311) and mean absolute error (MAE) values (1.13 m) in the test dataset and had high reliability in the overall depth distribution. The water level increased by 9.36 m at a rate of 0.47 m/y, and the water storage increased by 1.811 km3 from 1998 to 2018 based on inversion depth. The water level change was consistent with that of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) method. Our work shows that this method may be employed to study the water depth distribution and its changes by combining with bathymetric data and satellite imagery in shallow lakes.

Monitoring and evaluation Al-Razzaza lake changes in Iraq using GIS and remote sensing technology,"This study uses remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems GIS to monitor and evaluate the changes in the shoreline and the surface water area of Al-Razzazah Lake in Iraq from the year 1989 until 2020. Based on six satellite Landsat images of the study area for the years 1989, 1999, 2002, 2015, 2019, and 2020, changes were evaluated and mapped. Two methods; Support Vector Machine SVM and ISO cluster classifiers have been used to classify and extract the surface water area. The results showed the great change and the heavy loss that this lake was exposed until the year 2019. The surface water area decreased by 84.1% from 1631.72 km2 in 1989 to 259.65 km2 in 2019. Also, the shoreline was decreased by 63.4% from 451.98 km in 1989 to 165.46 km in 2019. Most changes happened in the north part and east part of the lake. Otherwise, an increase in the surface area of the lake was observed in the year 2020. This indicates the lake's recovery again, which forces the responsible authorities to take the necessary management to maintain the lake's continuity and prevent drought. The retraction ratio of the shoreline and surface water area of Al-Razzazah Lake was in ascending values from the year 1989 up to 2019 at an extreme rate. This retraction negatively affects Iraq; socially, economically, and environmentally alike. It determines the quantity available to the lake and its default age.

Predicting the settlement of mine waste dump using multi-source remote sensing and a secondary consolidation model,"The settlement (or subsidence) of mine waste dump is likely to cause landslides, thereby imposing threats on the safety of human beings and other local properties. Hence, it is essential to accurately predict the settlement for the early-warning of settlement-induced geohazards. Traditional mechanical methods require in situ mechanical parameters and the geological structure of mine waste dump, narrowing their practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a remote sensing-based method for predicting the settlement of mine waste dump without the requirement for field observations. Firstly, the historical settlement and thickness of mine waste dump were measured by space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and photogrammetry techniques, respectively. Secondly, the temporal evolution of the settlement of mine waste dump was described by a secondary consolidation model. Thirdly, the parameters of the secondary consolidation model were inverted based on the InSAR-measured historical settlements and photogrammetry-estimated thickness. Finally, the evolution trend of the settlement of the mine waste dump was predicted with the secondary consolidation model and its inverted parameters. The proposed method was tested over a mine waste dump in Weijiamao open-pit mine, China. The result shows that the root mean square error of the predicted time-series settlement is about 0.8 cm. The presented method will be beneficial to the assessment and early-warning of the settlement-related geohazards of mine waste dumps over a large area.

A review of multi-sensor fusion slam systems based on 3D LIDAR,"The ability of intelligent unmanned platforms to achieve autonomous navigation and positioning in a large-scale environment has become increasingly demanding, in which LIDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the mainstream of research schemes. However, the LIDAR-based SLAM system will degenerate and affect the localization and mapping effects in extreme environments with high dynamics or sparse features. In recent years, a large number of LIDAR-based multi-sensor fusion SLAM works have emerged in order to obtain a more stable and robust system. In this work, the development process of LIDAR-based multi-sensor fusion SLAM and the latest research work are highlighted. After summarizing the basic idea of SLAM and the necessity of multi-sensor fusion, this paper introduces the basic principles and recent work of multi-sensor fusion in detail from four aspects based on the types of fused sensors and data coupling methods. Meanwhile, we review some SLAM datasets and compare the performance of five open-source algorithms using the UrbanNav dataset. Finally, the development trend and popular research directions of SLAM based on 3D LIDAR multi-sensor fusion are discussed and summarized."
Global and local contrastive self-supervised learning for semantic segmentation of HR remote sensing images,"Recently, supervised deep learning has achieved a great success in remote sensing image (RSI) semantic segmentation. However, supervised learning for semantic segmentation requires a large number of labeled samples, which is difficult to obtain in the field of remote sensing. A new learning paradigm, self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve such problems by pretraining a general model with a large number of unlabeled images and then fine-tuning it on a downstream task with very few labeled samples. Contrastive learning is a typical method of SSL that can learn general invariant features. However, most existing contrastive learning methods are designed for classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation, which may be suboptimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level discrimination. Therefore, we propose a global style and local matching contrastive learning network (GLCNet) for RSI semantic segmentation. Specifically, first, the global style contrastive learning module is used to better learn an image-level representation, as we consider that style features can better represent the overall image features. Next, the local features matching the contrastive learning module is designed to learn the representations of local regions, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation. We evaluate four RSI semantic segmentation datasets, and the experimental results show that our method mostly outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pretraining method. Specifically, with 1% annotation from the original dataset, our approach improves Kappa by 6% on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our method outperforms supervised learning methods when there are some differences between the datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks. Our study promotes the development of SSL in the field of RSI semantic segmentation. Sin..."
Remote sensing of floral resources for pollinators–new horizons from satellites to drones,"Insect pollinators are affected by the spatio-temporal distribution of floral resources, which are dynamic across time and space, and also influenced heavily by anthropogenic activities. There is a need for spatial data describing the time-varying spatial distribution of flowers, which can be used within behavioral and ecological studies. However, this information is challenging to obtain. Traditional field techniques for mapping flowers are often laborious and limited to relatively small areas, making it difficult to assess how floral resources are perceived by pollinators to guide their behaviors. Conversely, remote sensing of plant traits is a relatively mature technique now, and such technologies have delivered valuable data for identifying and measuring non-floral dynamics in plant systems, particularly leaves, stems and woody biomass in a wide range of ecosystems from local to global scales. However, monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant floral resources has been notably scarce in remote sensing studies. Recently, lightweight drone technology has been adopted by the ecological community, offering a capability for flexible deployment in the field, and delivery of centimetric resolution data, providing a clear opportunity for capturing fine-grained information on floral resources at key times of the flowering season. In this review, we answer three key questions of relevance to pollination science – can remote sensing deliver information on (a) how isolated are floral resources? (b) What resources are available within a flower patch? And (c) how do floral patches change over time? We explain how such information has potential to deepen ecological understanding of the distribution of floral resources that feed pollinators and the parameters that determine their navigational and foraging choices based on the sensory information they extract at different spatial scales. We provide examples of how such data can be used to generate new insights into pollinator behaviors in distinct landscape types and their resilience to environmental change.

Discovering inclusivity in remote sensing: Leaving no one behind,"Innovative and beneficial science stems from diverse teams and authorships that are inclusive of many perspectives. In this paper, we explore the status of inclusivity in remote sensing academic publishing, using an audit of peer-reviewed journal editorial board composition. Our findings demonstrate diversity deficiency in gender and country of residence, limiting the majority of editors to men residing in four countries. We also examine the many challenges underrepresented communities within our field face, such as implicit bias, harsher reviews, and fewer citations. We assert that in the field of remote sensing, the gatekeepers are not representative of the global society and this lack of representation restricts what research is valued and published, and ultimately who becomes successful. We present an action plan to help make the field of remote sensing more diverse and inclusive and urge every individual to consider their role as editor, author, reviewer, or reader. We believe that each of us have a choice to continue to align with a journal/institution/society that is representative of the dynamic state of our field and its people, ensuring that no one is left behind while discovering all the fascinating possibilities in remote sensing.

A review of earth observation-based drought studies in Southeast Asia,"Drought is a recurring natural climatic hazard event over terrestrial land; it poses devastating threats to human health, the economy, and the environment. Given the increasing climate crisis, it is likely that extreme drought phenomena will become more frequent, and their impacts will probably be more devastating. Drought observations from space, therefore, play a key role in dissimilating timely and accurate information to support early warning drought management and mitigation planning, particularly in sparse in-situ data regions. In this paper, we reviewed drought-related studies based on Earth observation (EO) products in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2021. The results of this review indicated that drought publications in the region are on the increase, with a majority (70%) of the studies being undertaken in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. These countries also accounted for nearly 97% of the economic losses due to drought extremes. Vegetation indices from multispectral optical remote sensing sensors remained a primary source of data for drought monitoring in the region. Many studies (~21%) did not provide accuracy assessment on drought mapping products, while precipitation was the main data source for validation. We observed a positive association between spatial extent and spatial resolution, suggesting that nearly 81% of the articles focused on the local and national scales. Although there was an increase in drought research interest in the region, challenges remain regarding large-area and long time-series drought measurements, the combined drought approach, machine learning-based drought prediction, and the integration of multi-sensor remote sensing products (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2). Satellite EO data could be a substantial part of the future efforts that are necessary for mitigating drought-related challenges, ensuring food security, establishing a more sustainable economy, and the preservation of the natural environment in the region."
Land degradation trend in the climatic types of Fars province using remote sensing and climatic variables,"Land degradation rapidly increased in developing countries. Changes in climate and land use in Fars province in the past few decades have intensified the process of destruction and desertification. In the present research, satellite data was used to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of vegetation and its relationship with climate changes in the climate samples of Fars province in the years 2000 to 2020. The trend of changes of these variables in time with the Mann-Kendall method and in determining the time of change and spatial correlation, Pettit's test and Pearson's correlation test were used, respectively. The trend of NDVI in arid and semi-arid climates is increasing and the point of change is from 2010 onwards. Based on this, it can be expected that in most regions of Fars, we see a decrease in the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation (increase in evaporation) and the decadence trend is increasing. Precipitation has no trend and the surface temperature is decreasing. The spatial pattern of NDVI and precipitation trend is increasing in more than 70% of the region (south), and AI and LST are decreasing in more than 65% of the region (central). NDVI changes spatial correlation with LST, precipitation and AI variables showed that the type of relationship and the strength of correlation were different in climatic regions. The strongest correlations were seen in the cold ultra-arid climates in the northeast and the temperate Mediterranean located in the northwest of the province."
Remoteclip: A vision language foundation model for remote sensing,"General-purpose foundation models have led to recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). In remote sensing, self-supervised learning (SSL) and masked image modeling (MIM) have been adopted to build foundation models. However, these models primarily learn low-level features and require annotated data for fine-tuning. Moreover, they are inapplicable for retrieval and zero-shot applications due to the lack of language understanding. To address these limitations, we propose RemoteCLIP, the first vision-language foundation model for remote sensing that aims to learn robust visual features with rich semantics and aligned text embeddings for seamless downstream application. To address the scarcity of pretraining data, we leverage data scaling which converts heterogeneous annotations into a unified image-caption data format based on box-to-caption (B2C) and mask-to-box (M2B) conversion. By further incorporating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, we produce a 12× larger pretraining dataset than the combination of all available datasets. RemoteCLIP can be applied to a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification, linear probing, k-NN classification, few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and object counting in remote sensing images. Evaluation of 16 datasets, including a newly introduced RemoteCount benchmark to test the object counting ability, shows that RemoteCLIP consistently outperforms baseline foundation models across different model scales. Impressively, RemoteCLIP beats the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 9.14% mean recall on the RSITMD dataset and 8.92% on the RSICD dataset. For zero-shot classification, our RemoteCLIP outperforms the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) baseline by up to 6.39% average accuracy on 12 downstream datasets."
UIEGAN: Adversarial Learning-based Photo-realistic Image Enhancement for Intelligent Underwater Environment Perception,"Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is an essential task for intelligent environment perception in underwater remote visual sensing scenarios. However, the computing power of mobile platforms limits the usage of larger scale models. In this article, we propose a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture [UIE network (UIENet)] to enhance underwater images from visual sensors. We also involve the architecture into a generative adversarial network (UIEGAN) model against a supervised discriminator to further perfect its corrective capabilities for the photorealistic images with more global appearance and local details. The multiresolution counterparts are embedded into the generator to diversify the feature representation of the original inputs. Further, UIEGAN guides the spatial attention module (SAM) and the channel attention module (CAM) to jointly enhance the global-local connection of the image. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets of UIEB and UFO-120 and report better performance than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schemes, exceeding 15.43% and 12.85% on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) than the baselines of these datasets. Besides, by testing on the UIEB challenge, URPC and SQUID datasets without any reference images, our scheme outperforms the other methods on evaluation metrics to validate its generalization performance, and meanwhile uses a series of ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the functional modules."
Advancements in the satellite sensing of the impacts of climate and variability on bush encroachment in savannah rangelands,"An increase in shrubs or woody species is likely, directly or indirectly, to significantly affect rural livelihoods, wildlife/livestock productivity and conservation efforts. Poor and inappropriate land use management practices have resulted in rangeland degradation, particularly in semi-arid regions, and this has amplified the bush encroachment rate in many African countries, particularly in key savannah rangelands. The rate of encroachment is also perceived to be connected to other environmental factors, such as climate change, fire and rainfall variability, which may influence the structure and density of the shrubs (woody plants), when compared to uncontrolled grazing. Remote sensing has provided robust data for global studies on both bush encroachment and climate variability over multiple decades, and these data have complemented the local and regional evidence and process studies. This paper thus provides a detailed review of the advancements in the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of bush encroachment on the African continent, which is fuelled by climate variability in the rangeland areas. An understanding of how bush encroachment is fuelled by climate variability and change, as well as its impact on rangelands in the semi-arid areas, is still limited due to the scanty and, at times, fragmented research, especially when it comes to using remote sensing technology. This study also highlights the scientific knowledge gap that exists regarding the impact of climate variability on rangelands, which has yet to be explored by using remotely-sensed data. From a remote sensing viewpoint, rangeland monitoring is challenging when it comes to discriminating between the different herbaceous layers and implementing management practices. Overall, this review emphasizes the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in tracking the impact of climate change on savannah rangelands.

Application of Remote-Sensing-Based Hydraulic Model and Hydrological Model in Flood Simulation,"Floods are one of the main natural disaster threats to the safety of people’s lives and property. Flood hazards intensify as the global risk of flooding increases. The control of flood disasters on the basin scale has always been an urgent problem to be solved that is firmly associated with the sustainable development of water resources. As important nonengineering measures for flood simulation and flood control, the hydrological and hydraulic models have been widely applied in recent decades. In our study, on the basis of sufficient remote-sensing and hydrological data, a hydrological (Xin’anjiang (XAJ)) and a two-dimensional hydraulic (2D) model were constructed to simulate flood events and provide support for basin flood management. In the Chengcun basin, the two models were applied, and the model parameters were calibrated by the parameter estimation (PEST) automatic calibration algorithm in combination with the measured data of 10 typical flood events from 1990 to 1996. Results show that the two models performed well in the Chengcun basin. The average Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percentage error of peak discharge (PE), and percentage error of flood volume (RE) were 0.79, 16.55%, and 18.27%, respectively, for the XAJ model, and those values were 0.76, 12.83%, and 11.03% for 2D model. These results indicate that the models had high accuracy, and hydrological and hydraulic models both had good application performance in the Chengcun basin. The study can a provide decision-making basis and theoretical support for flood simulation, and the formulation of flood control and disaster mitigation measures in the basin."
UNetFormer: A UNet-like transformer for efficient semantic segmentation of remote sensing urban scene imagery,"Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed urban scene images is required in a wide range of practical applications, such as land cover mapping, urban change detection, environmental protection, and economic assessment. Driven by rapid developments in deep learning technologies, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has dominated semantic segmentation for many years. CNN adopts hierarchical feature representation, demonstrating strong capabilities for information extraction. However, the local property of the convolution layer limits the network from capturing the global context. Recently, as a hot topic in the domain of computer vision, Transformer has demonstrated its great potential in global information modelling, boosting many vision-related tasks such as image classification, object detection, and particularly semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based decoder and construct an UNet-like Transformer (UNetFormer) for real-time urban scene segmentation. For efficient segmentation, the UNetFormer selects the lightweight ResNet18 as the encoder and develops an efficient global–local attention mechanism to model both global and local information in the decoder. Extensive experiments reveal that our method not only runs faster but also produces higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art lightweight models. Specifically, the proposed UNetFormer achieved 67.8% and 52.4% mIoU on the UAVid and LoveDA datasets, respectively, while the inference speed can achieve up to 322.4 FPS with a 512 × 512 input on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. In further exploration, the proposed Transformer-based decoder combined with a Swin Transformer encoder also achieves the state-of-the-art result (91.3% F1 and 84.1% mIoU) on the Vaihingen dataset.

Broadband convolutional processing using band-alignment-tunable heterostructures,"Broadband convolutional processing is critical to high-precision image recognition and is of use in remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Implementing in-sensor broadband convolutional processing using conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology is, however, challenging because broadband sensing and convolutional processing require the use of the same physical processes. Here we show that a palladium diselenide/molybdenum ditelluride van der Waals heterostructure can provide simultaneous broadband image sensing and convolutional processing. The band alignment between type-II and type-III heterojunctions of the photovoltaic heterostructure is gate tunable, and the devices exhibit linear light-intensity dependence for both positive and negative photoconductivity, as well as linear gate dependence for the broadband photoresponse. Our in-sensor broadband convolutional processing improves recognition accuracy for multi-band images compared with conventional single-band-based convolutional neural networks.

Urban flood resilience evaluation based on GIS and multi-source data: a case study of Changchun City,"With extreme rainfall events and rapid urbanization, urban flood disaster events are increasing dramatically. As a key flood control city in China, Changchun City suffers casualties and economic losses every year due to floods. The improvement of flood resilience has become an important means for cities to resist flood risks. Therefore, this paper constructs an assessment model of urban flood resilience from four aspects: infrastructure, environment, society and economy. Then, it quantifies infrastructure and environmental vulnerability based on GIS, and uses TOPSIS to quantify social and economic recoverability. Finally, based on k-means clustering of infrastructure and environmental vulnerability and social and economic recoverability, the flood resilience of Changchun City was evaluated. The results show that different factors have different effects on flood resilience, and cities with low infrastructure and environmental vulnerability and high socioeconomic recoverability are more resilient in the face of floods. In addition, cities in the same cluster have the same flood resilience characteristics. The proposed framework can be extended to other regions of China or different countries by simply modifying the indicator system according to different regions, providing experience for regional flood mitigation and improving flood resilience."
Dynamic prediction method of 3D spatial information of coal mining subsidence water area integrated with landsat remote sensing and knothe time function,"Subsidence water disaster has become a major problem to the ecological environment because of the submerged villages, farmland destruction, and ecological destructive changes in the mining subsidence area of high-water level. Taking the 1031 working face of Wugou Coal Mine in Huaibei, Anhui, China, as the research subject, (1) a three-dimensional (3D) spatial information dynamic prediction method was proposed for high-water-level coal mining subsidence areas by combining the Knothe time function based on the probability integration method (PIM) and the principle of water balance. (2) The dynamic evolution law of the water accumulation area in the high-water-level coal mining subsidence area was studied. (3) The applicability of the dynamic prediction model of the water accumulation range in the high-water-level coal mining subsidence area was verified. The results showed that the dynamic prediction of the 3D spatial information of the high diving area is highly accurate and can be suitable for the dynamic prediction by comparison with the results of remote sensing monitoring and field measurement. As a result, technical reference and theoretical basis for the comprehensive assessment and remediation of the ecological environment of the high diving mining subsidence area were proposed.

"Lightweight, pre-trained transformers for remote sensing timeseries","Machine learning methods for satellite data have a range of societally relevant applications, but labels used to train models can be difficult or impossible to acquire. Self-supervision is a natural solution in settings with limited labeled data, but current self-supervised models for satellite data fail to take advantage of the characteristics of that data, including the temporal dimension (which is critical for many applications, such as monitoring crop growth) and availability of data from many complementary sensors (which can significantly improve a model's predictive performance). We present Presto (the Pretrained Remote Sensing Transformer), a model pre-trained on remote sensing pixel-timeseries data. By designing Presto specifically for remote sensing data, we can create a significantly smaller but performant model. Presto excels at a wide variety of globally distributed remote sensing tasks and performs competitively with much larger models while requiring far less compute. Presto can be used for transfer learning or as a feature extractor for simple models, enabling efficient deployment at scale."
Control system development and implementation of a CNC laser engraver for environmental use with remote imaging,"This article is aimed at studying the features of the control systems development for a small-sized Computer Numerical Control (CNC) portative laser engraver. The CNC is implemented in mobile maintenance and repair platforms for remote sensing of the environment where the wild environment may not allow us to access the animals and places. The proposed work in this paper is based on recent research, which shows that applying the automated CNC speeds up the processes of repair, modernizes the equipment size, and significantly reduces the economic costs; accordingly, the authors developed a block diagram of a portable CNC laser engraver. The choice of the hardware was also made, taking into account the possibility of quick replacement in the field, which reduces the repair time and the cost of the developed layout. A control system based on the selected modules was synthesized, and a stability check was carried out using MatLab tools. To check the correctness of the developed control system, the authors developed and assembled an experimental layout to illustrate the results of engraving on such a layout. Finally, the stability and sensitivity of the proposed system have been obtained and proved that the system works in a comfortable zone of stability. The obtained results show that the proposed CNC laser engraver has achieved the expected improvements (high speed, small size, short production and repairing time, minimum human influence factor, and achieving a better outcome).

Quantifying the influences of driving factors on land surface temperature during 2003–2018 in China using convergent cross mapping method,"The relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and environmental factors is complex and nonlinear. To determine these relationships for China, this study analyzed the driving effects of air temperature, vegetation index, soil moisture, net surface radiation, precipitation, aerosols, evapotranspiration, and water vapor on LST based on remote-sensing and reanalysis data from 2003–2018, using a convergent cross-mapping method. During the study period, air temperature and net surface radiation were the dominant drivers of LST with a cross-mapping skill above 0.9. Vegetation index and evapotranspiration were the secondary drivers of LST with a cross-mapping skill that was higher than 0.5. Except for air temperature and net surface radiation, the direction and strength of the effects of the driving factors on LST were related to the climate type. The effects of air temperature and net radiation on LST diminished from north to south, indicating that LST was more sensitive to air temperature and net radiation in energy-limited regions. However, the effects of vegetation index and evapotranspiration on LST varied significantly across climate zones; that is, positive effects were mostly in non-monsoonal zones and negative effects were primarily in monsoonal zones. Our results quantified the driving role of environmental factors on LST and provided a comprehensive understanding of LST dynamics."
SCViT: A spatial-channel feature preserving vision transformer for remote sensing image scene classification,"Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are widely used in remote sensing image scene classification and can obtain excellent performances. However, the stacked receptive fields in the CNN-based methods have limitations in modeling the long-range dependencies of local features. The vision transformer (ViT) model provides a good solution as it directly considers the global interactions of local patches by the self-attention mechanism. However, the vanilla ViT model, which simply splits images into fixed-size patches treated as tokens, mainly considers the global information in the spatial domain. In this article, a spatial-channel feature preserving ViT (SCViT) model is proposed, which considers both the detailed geometric information of the high-spatial-resolution (HSR) imagery and the contribution of the different channels contained in the classification token. First, in the proposed method, tokens are generated by progressively aggregating the neighboring overlapping patches to extract the local structural features of the imagery. Second, a multihead self-attention (MSA) mechanism is used to model the global interactions of the tokens in the encoder. A lightweight channel attention (LCA) module is then introduced to consider the importance of the different channels in the classification token. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used to acquire the final results. Compared with the state-of-the-art scene classification methods, the experimental results confirm the potential of using ViT models in remote sensing image scene classification."

A review of deep learning in multiscale agricultural sensing,"Population growth, climate change, and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic are imposing increasing pressure on global agricultural production. The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue throughout the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review. We hope that this work can act as a reference for the global agricultural community regarding DL in PA and can inspire deeper and broader research to promote the evolution of modern agriculture."
UAV in the advent of the twenties: Where we stand and what is next,"The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has surged in the last two decades, making them popular instruments for a wide range of applications, and leading to a remarkable number of scientific contributions in geoscience, remote sensing and engineering. However, the development of best practices for high quality of UAV mapping are often overlooked representing a drawback for their wider adoption. UAV solutions then require an inter-disciplinary research, integrating different expertise and combining several hardware and software components on the same platform. Despite the high number of peer-reviewed papers on UAVs, little attention has been given to the interaction between research topics from different domains (such as robotics and computer vision) that impact the use of UAV in remote sensing. The aim of this paper is to (i) review best practices for the use of UAVs for remote sensing and mapping applications and (ii) report on current trends - including adjacent domains - for UAV use and discuss their future impact in photogrammetry and remote sensing. Hardware developments, navigation and acquisition strategies, and emerging solutions for data processing in innovative applications are considered in this analysis. As the number and the heterogeneity of debated topics are large, the paper is organized according to very specific questions considered most relevant by the authors.

Deep learning in multimodal remote sensing data fusion: A comprehensive review,"With the extremely rapid advances in remote sensing (RS) technology, a great quantity of Earth observation (EO) data featuring considerable and complicated heterogeneity are readily available nowadays, which renders researchers an opportunity to tackle current geoscience applications in a fresh way. With the joint utilization of EO data, much research on multimodal RS data fusion has made tremendous progress in recent years, yet these developed traditional algorithms inevitably meet the performance bottleneck due to the lack of the ability to comprehensively analyze and interpret strongly heterogeneous data. Hence, this non-negligible limitation further arouses an intense demand for an alternative tool with powerful processing competence. Deep learning (DL), as a cutting-edge technology, has witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in numerous computer vision tasks owing to its impressive ability in data representation and reconstruction. Naturally, it has been successfully applied to the field of multimodal RS data fusion, yielding great improvement compared with traditional methods. This survey aims to present a systematic overview in DL-based multimodal RS data fusion. More specifically, some essential knowledge about this topic is first given. Subsequently, a literature survey is conducted to analyze the trends of this field. Some prevalent sub-fields in the multimodal RS data fusion are then reviewed in terms of the to-be-fused data modalities, i.e., spatiospectral, spatiotemporal, light detection and ranging-optical, synthetic aperture radar-optical, and RS-Geospatial Big Data fusion. Furthermore, We collect and summarize some valuable resources for the sake of the development in multimodal RS data fusion. Finally, the remaining challenges and potential future directions are highlighted.

Google Earth Engine and artificial intelligence (AI): a comprehensive review,"Remote sensing (RS) plays an important role gathering data in many critical domains (e.g., global climate change, risk assessment and vulnerability reduction of natural hazards, resilience of ecosystems, and urban planning). Retrieving, managing, and analyzing large amounts of RS imagery poses substantial challenges. Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a scalable, cloud-based, geospatial retrieval and processing platform. GEE also provides access to the vast majority of freely available, public, multi-temporal RS data and offers free cloud-based computational power for geospatial data analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are a critical enabling technology to automating the interpretation of RS imagery, particularly on object-based domains, so the integration of AI methods into GEE represents a promising path towards operationalizing automated RS-based monitoring programs. In this article, we provide a systematic review of relevant literature to identify recent research that incorporates AI methods in GEE. We then discuss some of the major challenges of integrating GEE and AI and identify several priorities for future research. We developed an interactive web application designed to allow readers to intuitively and dynamically review the publications included in this literature review."
"Exploring the relationships between land surface temperature and its influencing factors using multisource spatial big data: a case study in Beijing, China","A better understanding of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and its influencing factors is important to the livable, healthy, and sustainable development of cities. In this study, we focused on the potential effect of human daily activities on LST from a short-term perspective. Beijing was selected as a case city, and Weibo check-in data were employed to measure the intensity of human daily activities. MODIS data were analyzed and used for urban LST measurement. We adopted spatial autocorrelation analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and spatial autoregressive model to explore the influence mechanism of LST, and the study was performed at both the pixel scale and subdistrict scale. The results show that there is a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation between LSTs, and urban landscape components are strong explainers of LST. A significant and positive effect of human daily activities on LST is captured at night, and this effect can last and accumulate over a few hours. The variables of land use functions and building forms show varying impacts on LST from daytime to nighttime. Moreover, the comparison between results at different scales indicates that the relationships between LST and some explainers are sensitive to the study scale. The current study enriches the literature on LST and offers meaningful and practical suggestions for the monitoring, early warning, and management of urban thermal environment with remote sensing technology and spatial big data sources."
Estimation of fractional vegetation cover dynamics based on satellite remote sensing in pakistan: a comprehensive study on the FVC and its drivers,"The present investigation exposes the significant variations of Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and drivers from year 2003 to 2013 in Pakistan. It is directly calculated by remote-sensing data using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI) and Compound Night Light Index/Defense Meteorological Program/Operational Line-Scan System (CNLI/DMSP/OLS). The spatial patterns of FVC variation are mainly categorized into three levels, low (<10%), medium (40%) and high (70%), with consequent findings. The FVC time series analysis exhibited the fitting curve with straight lines at 0.29 (29%). These findings displayed the utmost annual mean values 26% to 31% and 28% and 29% correspond to level 70% and 40%, respectively. Among all levels, level 10% has the lowest mean. The trend analysis displayed the low FVC for the southwest and south-eastern regions. This is attributed to industrialization, urbanization, land use, land cover change, and related climatic factors: the northeast and the northwest areas displayed medium and high FVC due to less human disturbance. Using different remotely sensed data, human activities (industrialization and urbanization, etc.) and climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature are considered driving factors of FVC dynamics. Finally, the correlation value of the coefficient verified the link between climatic factors, FVC and CNLI. These findings present the positive correlation of FVC with rainfall and the negative with compounded night light index and temperature.

"Automatic detection of aquatic weeds: A case study in the Guadiana River, Spain","The spread of aquatic invasive plants is a major concern in several zones of the world's geography. These plants, which are not part of the natural ecosystem, cause a negative impact to the environment, as well as to economy and society. In Spain, large areas of Guadiana (the second-longest river in Spain) have been invaded by such plants. Among the strategies to address this problem, monitoring and detection play an important role to control the spatiotemporal distribution of the invasive plants. The main objective of this work is to develop a methodology able to automatically detect the geolocation of aquatic invasive plants using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. To this end, several classification algorithms have been applied to freely available multispectral satellite imagery, collected by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite. A quantitative and comparative assessment is conducted using different machine and deep learning algorithms from classical methods, such as unsupervised K-means to supervised random forests and convolutional neural networks. This study also proposes a methodology for validating the obtained classification results, generating synthetic ground truth images based on available high spatial resolution imagery. The obtained results demonstrate the suitability of some of the considered algorithms for automatic detection of aquatic weeds in satellite images with medium spatial resolution."
A comprehensive review on deep learning based remote sensing image super-resolution methods,"Satellite imageries are an important geoinformation source for different applications in the Earth Science field. However, due to the limitation of the optic and sensor technologies and the high cost to update the sensors and equipments, the spectral and spatial resolution of the Earth Observation satellites may not meet the desired requirements. Thus, Remote Sensing Image Super-resolution (RSISR) which aims at restoring the high-resolution (HR) remote sensing images from the given low-resolution (LR) images has drawn considerable attention and witnessed the rapid development of the deep learning (DL) algorithms. In this research, we aim to comprehensively review the DL-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods on optical remote sensing images. First, we introduce the DL techniques utilized in SISR. Second, we summarize the RSISR algorithms thoroughly, including the DL models, commonly used remote sensing datasets, loss functions, and performance evaluation metrics. Third, we present a new multi-sensor dataset that consists of Very High-Resolution satellite images from different satellites of various landscapes and evaluate the performance of some state-of-the-art super-resolution methods on this dataset. Finally, we envision the challenges and future research in the RSISR field.

Two-step alignment of mixed reality devices to existing building data,"With the emergence of XR technologies, the demand for new time- and cost-saving applications in the AEC industry based on these new technologies is rapidly increasing. Their real-time feedback and digital interaction in the field makes these systems very well suited for construction site monitoring, maintenance, project planning, and so on. However, the continuously changing environments of construction sites and facilities requires extraordinary robust and dynamic data acquisition technologies to capture and update the built environment. New XR devices already have the hardware to accomplish these tasks, but the framework to document and geolocate multi-temporal mappings of a changing environment is still very much the subject of ongoing research. The goal of this research is, therefore, to study whether Lidar and photogrammetric technologies can be adapted to process XR sensory data and align multiple time series in the same coordinate system. Given the sometimes drastic changes on sites, we do not only use the sensory data but also any preexisting remote sensing data and as-is or as-designed BIM to aid the registration. In this work, we specifically study the low-resolution geometry and image matching of the Hololens 2 during consecutive stages of a construction. During the experiments, multiple time series of constructions are captured and registered. The experiments show that XR-captured data can be reliably registered to preexisting datasets with an accuracy that matches or exceeds the resolution of the sensory data. These results indicate that this method is an excellent way to align generic XR devices to a wide variety of existing reference data."
Estimation of ground PM2. 5 concentrations in Pakistan using convolutional neural network and multi-pollutant satellite images,"During the last few decades, worsening air quality has been diagnosed in many cities around the world. The accurately prediction of air pollutants, particularly, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is extremely important for environmental management. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) P-CNN model is presented in this paper, which uses seven different pollutant satellite images, such as Aerosol index (AER AI), Methane (CH4), Carbon monoxide (CO), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3) and Sulfur dioxide (SO2), as auxiliary variables to estimate daily average PM2.5 concentrations. This study estimates daily average of PM2.5 concentrations in various cities of Pakistan (Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi) by using satellite images. The dataset contains a total of 2562 images from May-2019 to April-2020. We compare and analyze AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50 and P-CNN model on every dataset. The accuracy of machine learning models was checked with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results show that P-CNN is more accurate than other approaches in estimating PM2.5 concentrations from satellite images. This study presents robust model using satellite images, useful for estimating PM2.5 concentrations."
Novel piecewise distance based on adaptive region key-points extraction for LCCD with VHR remote-sensing images,"Land cover change detection (LCCD) with very high-resolution remote-sensing images (VHR_RSIs) is important in observing surface change on Earth. However, pseudo-changes usually reduce the accuracy of the detection map. In this article, a novel piecewise distance based on adaptive region key-points extraction called sparse key-point distance (SKPD) is developed to measure the change magnitude between the bitemporal VHR_RSIs for LCCD. The proposed approach consists of three steps. First, an adaptive region generation algorithm is promoted for exploring spatial–contextual information. Then, the adaptive region around each pixel is sparsely represented with the box-whisker plot theory, and the adaptive region is converted into a sparse key-point vector. Finally, a piecewise distance is defined to measure the change magnitude between the bitemporal images. While the entire VHR_RSIs are scanned and the proposed SKPD method proceeds on a pixel-by-pixel basis, a change magnitude image (CMI) can be generated and a binary threshold method can be applied on the CMI to obtain a change detection map. Experimental results based on four pairs of real VHR_RSIs and four state-of-the-art methods effectively demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach for achieving LCCD with VHR_RSIs, such as the improvements for the four datasets are 5.25%, 14.76%, 18.13%, and 22.24%, respectively, in terms of overall accuracy."
Perception and sensing for autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions: A survey,"Automated Driving Systems (ADS) open up a new domain for the automotive industry and offer new possibilities for future transportation with higher efficiency and comfortable experiences. However, perception and sensing for autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions have been the problem that keeps autonomous vehicles (AVs) from going to higher autonomy for a long time.

Deep convolutional neural networks for weeds and crops discrimination from UAS imagery,"Weeds are among the significant factors that could harm crop yield by invading crops and smother pastures, and significantly decrease the quality of the harvested crops. Herbicides are widely used in agriculture to control weeds; however, excessive use of herbicides in agriculture can lead to environmental pollution as well as yield reduction. Accurate mapping of crops/weeds is essential to determine weeds’ location and locally treat those areas. Increasing demand for flexible, accurate and lower cost precision agriculture technology has resulted in advancements in UAS-based remote sensing data collection and methods. Deep learning methods have been successfully employed for UAS data processing and mapping tasks in different domains. This research investigate, compares and evaluates the performance of deep learning methods for crop/weed discrimination on two open-source and published benchmark datasets captured by different UASs (field robot and UAV) and labeled by experts. We specifically investigate the following architectures: 1) U-Net Model 2) SegNet 3) FCN (FCN-32s, FCN-16s, FCN-8s) 4) DepLabV3+. The deep learning models were fine-tuned to classify the UAS datasets into three classes (background, crops, and weeds). The classification accuracy achieved by U-Net is 77.9% higher than 62.6% of SegNet, 68.4% of FCN-32s, 77.2% of FCN-16s, and slightly lower than 81.1% of FCN-8s, and 84.3% of DepLab v3+. Experimental results showed that the ResNet-18 based segmentation model such as DepLab v3+ could precisely extract weeds compared to other classifiers.

Spatial prioritization for wildfire mitigation by integrating heterogeneous spatial data: A new multi-dimensional approach for tropical rainforests,"Wildfires drive deforestation that causes various losses. Although many studies have used spatial approaches, a multi-dimensional analysis is required to determine priority areas for mitigation. This study identified priority areas for wildfire mitigation in Indonesia using a multi-dimensional approach including disaster, environmental, historical, and administrative parameters by integrating 20 types of multi-source spatial data. Spatial data were combined to produce susceptibility, carbon stock, and carbon emission models that form the basis for prioritization modelling. The developed priority model was compared with historical deforestation data. Legal aspects were evaluated for oil-palm plantations and mining with respect to their impact on wildfire mitigation. Results showed that 379,516 km2 of forests in Indonesia belong to the high-priority category and most of these are located in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and North Maluku. Historical data suggest that 19.50% of priority areas for wildfire mitigation have experienced deforestation caused by wildfires over the last ten years. Based on legal aspects of land use, 5.2% and 3.9% of high-priority areas for wildfire mitigation are in oil palm and mining areas, respectively. These results can be used to support the determination of high-priority areas for the REDD+ program and the evaluation of land use policies."
Swin transformer embedding UNet for remote sensing image semantic segmentation,"Global context information is essential for the semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images. However, most existing methods rely on a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is challenging to directly obtain the global context due to the locality of the convolution operation. Inspired by the Swin transformer with powerful global modeling capabilities, we propose a novel semantic segmentation framework for RS images called ST-U-shaped network (UNet), which embeds the Swin transformer into the classical CNN-based UNet. ST-UNet constitutes a novel dual encoder structure of the Swin transformer and CNN in parallel. First, we propose a spatial interaction module (SIM), which encodes spatial information in the Swin transformer block by establishing pixel-level correlation to enhance the feature representation ability of occluded objects. Second, we construct a feature compression module (FCM) to reduce the loss of detailed information and condense more small-scale features in patch token downsampling of the Swin transformer, which improves the segmentation accuracy of small-scale ground objects. Finally, as a bridge between dual encoders, a relational aggregation module (RAM) is designed to integrate global dependencies from the Swin transformer into the features from CNN hierarchically. Our ST-UNet brings significant improvement on the ISPRS-Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets, respectively. The code will be available at https://github.com/XinnHe/ST-UNet ."
Land-use/land-cover change detection based on a Siamese global learning framework for high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery,"Due to the abundant features of high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, change detection of these images is crucial to understanding the land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. However, previous works mostly focus on traditional binary change detection without considering the semantic information of the change classes. The latest progress of deep learning (DL) shows its advantages in HSR remote sensing images change detection. However, due to the large number of parameter calculations, the DL network always requires a large quantity of labeled data. In addition, DL methods for change detection usually follow a patch-based learning framework, which considers only the local area and leads to a sample imbalance problem for semantic change detection. To address the above issues, we first proposed a Siamese global learning (Siam-GL) framework, which is a novel semantic change detction framework for HSR remote sensing images. In Siam-GL, the Siamese architecture with shared parameters is constructed to effectively extract the representative features of bi-temporal HSR remote sensing images. The global hierarchical (G-H) sampling mechanism is designed to address the imbalanced training sample problem with insufficient samples. Furthermore, the binary change mask is added between the encoder and decoder to weaken the influence of the no-change regional background on the change regional foreground, further improving the accuracy of the proposed framework. The experimental results obtained with three diverse HSR datasets of typical Chinese cities demonstrated that the Siam-GL framework outperforms the advanced semantic change detection methods in terms of both quantity and quality. Moreover, to verify the generalization performance of the Siam-GL framework, a larger dataset was used for evaluation, and the results show that the Siam-GL framework has strong generalization performance."
Hyperspectral remote sensing for phenotyping the physiological drought response of common and tepary bean,"Proximal remote sensing offers a powerful tool for high-throughput phenotyping of plants for assessing stress response. Bean plants, an important legume for human consumption, are often grown in regions with limited rainfall and irrigation and are therefore bred to further enhance drought tolerance. We assessed physiological (stomatal conductance and predawn and midday leaf water potential) and ground- and tower-based hyperspectral remote sensing (400 to 2,400 nm and 400 to 900 nm, respectively) measurements to evaluate drought response in 12 common bean and 4 tepary bean genotypes across 3 field campaigns (1 predrought and 2 post-drought). Hyperspectral data in partial least squares regression models predicted these physiological traits (R2 = 0.20 to 0.55; root mean square percent error 16% to 31%). Furthermore, ground-based partial least squares regression models successfully ranked genotypic drought responses similar to the physiologically based ranks. This study demonstrates applications of high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensing for predicting plant traits and phenotyping drought response across genotypes for vegetation monitoring and breeding population screening."
TransUNetCD: A hybrid transformer network for change detection in optical remote-sensing images,"In the change detection (CD) task, the UNet architecture has achieved superior results. However, due to the inherent limitation of convolution operations, UNet is inadequate in learning global context and long-range spatial relations. Transformers can capture long-range feature dependencies, but the lack of low-level details may result in limited localization capabilities. Therefore, this article proposes an end-to-end encoding–decoding hybrid transformer model for CD, TransUNetCD, which has the advantages of both transformers and UNet. The model encodes the tokenized image patches from the convolutional neural network (CNN) feature map to extract rich global context information. The decoder upsamples the encoded features, connects them with higher-resolution multiscale features through skip connections to learn local–global semantic features, and restores the full spatial resolution of the feature map to achieve precise localization. The model proposed in this article not only solves the problem that redundant information is generated when extracting low-level features under the UNet framework, but also solves the problem that the relationship between each feature layer cannot be fully modeled and the optimal feature difference representation cannot be obtained. On this basis, we introduce a difference enhancement module to generate a difference feature map containing rich change information. By weighting each pixel and selectively aggregating features, the effectiveness of the network and the accuracy of extracting changing features are improved. The results on multiple datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, the TransUNetCD can further reduce false alarms and missed alarms, and the edge of the changing area is more accurate. The model has the highest score in each metric than other baseline models and has a robust generalization ability."
Remote sensing image classification: A comprehensive review and applications,"Remote sensing is mainly used to investigate sites of dams, bridges, and pipelines to locate construction materials and provide detailed geographic information. In remote sensing image analysis, the images captured through satellite and drones are used to observe surface of the Earth. The main aim of any image classification-based system is to assign semantic labels to captured images, and consequently, using these labels, images can be arranged in a semantic order. The semantic arrangement of images is used in various domains of digital image processing and computer vision such as remote sensing, image retrieval, object recognition, image annotation, scene analysis, content-based image analysis, and video analysis. The earlier approaches for remote sensing image analysis are based on low-level and mid-level feature extraction and representation. These techniques have shown good performance by using different feature combinations and machine learning approaches. These earlier approaches have used small-scale image dataset. The recent trends for remote sensing image analysis are shifted to the use of deep learning model. Various hybrid approaches of deep learning have shown much better results than the use of a single deep learning model. In this review article, a detailed overview of the past trends is presented, based on low-level and mid-level feature representation using traditional machine learning concepts. A summary of publicly available image benchmarks for remote sensing image analysis is also presented. A detailed summary is presented at the end of each section. An overview regarding the current trends of deep learning models is presented along with a detailed comparison of various hybrid approaches based on recent trends. The performance evaluation metrics are also discussed. This review article provides a detailed knowledge related to the existing trends in remote sensing image classification and possible future research directions.

SwinSUNet: Pure transformer network for remote sensing image change detection,"Convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract effective semantic features, so it was widely used for remote sensing image change detection (CD) in the latest years. CNN has acquired great achievements in the field of CD, but due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operation, it could not capture global information in space-time. The transformer was proposed in recent years and it can effectively extract global information, so it was used to solve computer vision (CV) tasks and achieved amazing success. In this article, we design a pure transformer network with Siamese U-shaped structure to solve CD problems and name it SwinSUNet. SwinSUNet contains encoder, fusion, and decoder, and all of them use Swin transformer blocks as basic units. Encoder has a Siamese structure based on hierarchical Swin transformer, so encoder can process bitemporal images in parallel and extract their multiscale features. Fusion is mainly responsible for the merge operation of the bitemporal features generated by the encoder. Like encoder, the decoder is also based on hierarchical Swin transformer. Different from the encoder, the decoder uses upsampling and merging (UM) block and Swin transformer blocks to recover the details of the change information. The encoder uses patch merging and Swin transformer blocks to generate effective semantic features. After the sequential process of these three modules, SwinSUNet will output the change maps. We did expensive experiments on four CD datasets, and in these experiments, SwinSUNet achieved better results than other related methods."
